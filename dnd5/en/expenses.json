    "description": "Most wealth is not in coins. It is measured in livestock,  grain,  land,  rights  to  collect  taxes,  or  rights to resources (such as a mine or a forest).\n\nGuilds, nobles, and royalty regulate trade. Chartered companies are granted rights to conduct trade  along  certain  routes,  to  send  merchant  ships  to various ports, or to buy or sell specific goods. Guilds set prices for the goods or services that they control, and determine who may or may not offer those goods and services. Merchants commonly exchange trade goods without using currency. The Trade Goods table shows the value of commonly  exchanged goods.",

    "description": "Lifestyle expenses provide you with a simple way to account  for  the  cost  of  living  in  a  fantasy  world.  They cover your accommodations, food and drink, and all your  other  necessities.  Furthermore,  expenses  cover the cost of maintaining your equipment so you can be ready when adventure next calls.\n\nAt  the  start  of  each  week  or  month  (your  choice), choose a lifestyle from the Expenses table and pay the price to sustain that lifestyle. The prices listed are per day, so if you wish to calculate the cost of your  chosen  lifestyle  over  a thirty-\u00AD‐‑day  period, multiply the listed price by 30. Your lifestyle might change from one period to the next, based on the funds you have at your disposal, or you might maintain the same lifestyle throughout your character’s career.\n\nYour lifestyle choice can have consequences. Maintaining a wealthy lifestyle might help you make contacts with the rich and powerful, though you run the  risk  of  attracting  thieves.  Likewise,  living  frugally might help you avoid criminals, but you are unlikely to make powerful connections.",

With no place to call home, you shelter wherever you can, sneaking into barns, huddling in old crates, and relying on the good graces of people better off than you.  A  wretched  lifestyle  presents  abundant  dangers. Violence, disease, and hunger follow you wherever you go. Other wretched people covet your armor, weapons, and adventuring gear, which represent a fortune by their standards. You are beneath the notice of most people.\n\n**_Squalid._** You live in a leaky stable, a mud-\u00AD‐‑floored  hut just outside town, or a vermin-\u00AD‐‑infested  boarding house  in  the  worst  part  of  town.  You  have  shelter from  the  elements, but  you  live  in  a  desperate  and often violent environment, in places rife with disease,  hunger,  and  misfortune.  You  are  beneath  the  notice of most people, and you have few legal protections.\n\nMost  people  at  this  lifestyle  level  have  suffered  some terrible  setback.  They  might  be  disturbed,  marked  as exiles, or suffer from disease.\n\n**_Poor._** A poor lifestyle means going without the comforts available in a stable community. Simple food and lodgings, threadbare clothing, and unpredictable conditions result in a sufficient, though probably unpleasant, experience. Your accommodations might be a room in a flophouse or in the common room above a tavern. You benefit from some legal protections, but you still have to contend  with  violence,  crime,  and  disease.  People  at this lifestyle level tend to be unskilled laborers, costermongers, peddlers, thieves, mercenaries, and other disreputable types.\n\n**_Modest._** A modest lifestyle keeps you out of the slums and ensures that you can maintain your equipment. You live in an older part of town, renting a  room  in  a  boarding  house,  inn,  or  temple.  You  don’t go hungry or thirsty, and your living conditions are clean, if simple. Ordinary people living modest lifestyles include soldiers with families, laborers, students, priests, hedge wizards, and the like.\n\n**_Comfortable._** Choosing a comfortable lifestyle means that you can afford nicer clothing and can easily maintain your equipment. You live in a small cottage in a middle-\u00AD‐‑class  neighborhood or in a private room at a fine inn. You associate with merchants, skilled tradespeople, and military  officers.\n\n  \n\n**_Wealthy._** Choosing a wealthy lifestyle means  living a life of luxury, though you might not have achieved the social status associated with the old money of nobility or royalty. You live a lifestyle comparable  to  that  of  a  highly  successful  merchant,  a favored servant of the royalty, or the owner of a few small businesses. You have respectable lodgings, usually a spacious home in a good part of town or a comfortable suite at a fine inn. You likely have a small staff of servants.\n\n**_Aristocratic._** You live a life of plenty and comfort. You move in circles populated by the most powerful people in the community. You have excellent lodgings, perhaps a townhouse in the nicest part of town or rooms in the finest inn. You dine at the best restaurants, retain the most skilled and fashionable tailor, and have servants attending to your every need.  You  receive  invitations  to  the  social  gatherings of the rich and powerful, and spend evenings in the company of politicians, guild leaders, high priests, and nobility.  You must also contend with the highest levels  of  deceit  and  treachery.  The  wealthier  you  are, the greater the chance you will be drawn into political intrigue as a pawn or participant."

        "content": "The expenses and lifestyles described here assume that you are spending your time between adventures in town, availing yourself  of  whatever services you can afford—paying for food and shelter, paying townspeople to sharpen your sword and repair your armor, and so on. Some characters, though,  might prefer to spend their time away from civilization, sustaining themselves in the wild by hunting, foraging, and repairing their own gear.\n\nMaintaining this kind of lifestyle doesn’t require you to spend  any  coin,  but  it  is time-\u00AD‐consuming.  If  you  spend  your time between adventures practicing a profession, you can eke out the equivalent of a poor lifestyle. Proficiency in the Survival  skill  lets you live at the equivalent of  a comfortable lifestyle."

    "description": "Adventurers can pay nonplayer characters to assist them or act on their behalf in a variety of circumstances. Most such hirelings have fairly ordinary  skills,  while  others  are  masters  of  a  craft  or art, and a few are experts with specialized adventuring skills.\n\nSome of the most basic types of hirelings appear on the Services table. Other common hirelings include any of the wide variety of people who inhabit a typical town or city,  when the adventurers pay them to perform a specific task. For example, a wizard might pay a carpenter to construct an elaborate  chest  (and  its  miniature  replica)  for  use  in the _secret chest_ spell. A fighter might commission a blacksmith to forge a special sword. A bard might pay a tailor to make exquisite clothing for an upcoming performance in front of the duke.\n\nOther hirelings provide more expert or dangerous services. Mercenary soldiers paid to help the adventurers take on a hobgoblin army are hirelings,  as  are  sages  hired  to  research  ancient  or  esoteric lore. If a high-\u00AD‐‑level  adventurer establishes a stronghold  of  some  kind,  he  or  she  might  hire  a whole staff of servants and agents to run the place, from  a  castellan  or  steward  to  menial  laborers  to keep the stables clean. These hirelings often enjoy a long-‐‑term  contract that includes a place to live within the stronghold as part of the offered compensation.",

        "content": "People  who  are  able  to  cast  spells  don’t  fall  into  the category of ordinary hirelings. It might be possible to find someone willing to cast a spell in exchange for coin or favors, but it is rarely easy and no established  pay  rates  exist.  As  a  rule,  the  higher  the level of the desired spell, the harder it is to find someone who can cast it and the more it costs.\n\nHiring  someone  to  cast  a  relatively  common  spell of 1st or 2nd level, such as _cure wounds_ or _identify_, is easy  enough  in  a  city  or  town,  and  might  cost  10  to 50  gold  pieces  (plus  the  cost  of  any  expensive material components). Finding someone able and willing to cast a higher-\u00AD‐‑level  spell might involve traveling  to  a  large  city,  perhaps  one  with  a university or prominent temple. Once found, the spellcaster might ask for a service instead of payment—the kind of service that only adventurers can provide, such as retrieving a rare item from a dangerous locale or traversing a monster-\u00AD‐‑infested  wilderness  to  deliver  something  important  to  a distant settlement."
