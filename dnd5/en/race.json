        "content": "### Racial  Traits\n\nThe description of each race includes racial traits that are common to members of that race. The following  entries  appear  among  the  traits  of  most races.\n\n#### Ability  Score  Increase\n\nEvery  race  increases  one  or  more  of  a  character’s ability scores.\n\n#### Age\n\nThe age entry notes the age when a member of the race is considered an adult, as well as the race’s expected lifespan. This information can help you decide how old your character is at the start of the game. You can choose any age for your character, which  could  provide  an  explanation  for  some  of  your ability scores. For example, if you play a young or very old character, your age could explain a particularly low Strength or Constitution score,  while advanced age could account for a high Intelligence or Wisdom.\n\n#### Alignment\n\nMost races have tendencies toward certain alignments, described in this entry. These are not binding for player characters, but considering why your dwarf is chaotic, for example, in defiance of lawful  dwarf  society  can  help  you  better  define  your character.\n\n#### Size\n\nCharacters  of  most  races  are  Medium,  a  size  category including creatures that are roughly 4 to 8 feet tall. Members of a few races are Small (between 2 and 4 feet tall), which means that certain rules of the game affect them differently. The most important of these rules is that Small characters have trouble wielding heavy weapons, as explained in “Equipment.”\n\n#### Speed\n\nYour  speed  determines  how  far  you  can  move  when traveling ( “Adventuring”) and fighting (“Combat”).\n\n#### Languages\n\nBy  virtue  of  your  race,  your  character  can  speak, read, and write certain languages.\n\n#### Subraces\n\nSome races have subraces. Members of a subrace have the traits of the parent race in addition to the traits specified for their subrace. Relationships among  subraces  vary  significantly  from  race  to  race and world to world."

On average, they live about 350 years.\n\n**_Alignment._** Most dwarves are lawful, believing firmly  in  the  benefits  of  a  well-\u00AD‐‑ordered  society.  They tend toward good as well, with a strong sense of fair play and a belief that everyone deserves to share in  the benefits of a just order.\n\n**_Size._** Dwarves  stand  between  4  and  5  feet  tall  and average about 150 pounds.

Your speed is not reduced by wearing heavy armor.\n\n**_Darkvision._** Accustomed to life underground, you have  superior  vision  in  dark  and  dim  conditions.  You can  see  in  dim light  within  60  feet  of  you  as  if  it  were bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim light.\n\nYou  can’t  discern  color  in  darkness,  only  shades  of gray.\n\n**_Dwarven  Resilience._** You  have  advantage  on saving throws against poison, and you have resistance against poison damage.\n\n**_Dwarven  Combat  Training._** You  have  proficiency with the battleaxe, handaxe, light hammer, and warhammer.\n\n**_Tool Proficiency._** You gain proficiency with the artisan’s  tools  of  your  choice:  smith’s  tools,  brewer’s supplies, or mason’s tools.\n\n**_Stonecunning._** Whenever you make an Intelligence (History) check related to the origin of stonework, you are considered proficient in the History  skill  and  add  double  your  proficiency  bonus to the check, instead of your normal proficiency bonus.\n\n**_Languages._** You can speak, read, and write Common  and  Dwarvish.  Dwarvish  is  full  of  hard consonants and guttural sounds, and those characteristics spill over into whatever other language a dwarf might speak."

An elf typically claims adulthood and an adult name around  the  age  of  100  and  can  live  to  be  750  years old.\n\n**_Alignment._** Elves love freedom, variety, and self-\u00AD‐‑ expression, so they lean strongly toward the gentler aspects of chaos. They value and protect others’ freedom  as  well  as  their  own,  and  they  are  more often good than not.\n\n**_Size._** Elves  range  from  under  5  to  over  6  feet  tall and have slender builds. Your size is Medium.\n\n**_Speed._** Your  base  walking  speed  is  30 feet.\n\n**_Darkvision._** Accustomed to twilit forests and the night sky, you have superior vision in dark and dim conditions.

You can’t discern color in darkness, only shades of gray.\n\n**_Keen  Senses._** You  have  proficiency  in  the Perception skill.\n\n**_Fey Ancestry._** You have advantage on saving throws  against  being  charmed,  and  magic  can’t  put you to sleep.\n\n**_Trance._** Elves don’t need to sleep. Instead, they meditate deeply, remaining semiconscious, for 4 hours  a  day.  (The  Common  word  for  such  meditation is “trance.”) While meditating, you can dream after a fashion; such dreams are actually mental exercises that  have  become  reflexive  through  years  of  practice. After resting in this way, you gain the same benefit that a human does from 8 hours of sleep.\n\n**_Languages._** You can speak, read, and write Common and Elvish. Elvish is fluid, with subtle intonations  and  intricate  grammar.  Elven  literature is rich and varied, and their songs and poems are famous among other races. Many bards learn their language so they can add Elvish ballads to their repertoires."

The Halfling language isn’t secret,  but  halflings  are  loath  to  share  it  with  others. They  write  very  little,  so  they  don’t  have  a  rich  body of literature.

Your draconic ancestry determines  the  size,  shape,  and  damage  type  of  the exhalation.\n\nWhen you use your breath weapon, each creature in the area of the exhalation must make a saving throw, the type of which is determined by your draconic ancestry. The DC for this saving throw equals 8 + your Constitution modifier + your proficiency  bonus.  A  creature  takes  2d6  damage  on  a failed save, and half as much damage on a successful one.  The  damage  increases  to  3d6  at  6th  level,  4d6  at 11th level, and 5d6 at 16th level.\n\nAfter  you  use  your  breath  weapon,  you  can’t  use  it again until you complete a short or long rest.\n\n**_Damage Resistance._** You have resistance to the damage  type  associated  with  your  draconic  ancestry.\n\n**_Languages._** You can speak, read, and write Common  and  Draconic.  Draconic  is  thought  to  be  one of the oldest languages and is often used in the study of magic.
