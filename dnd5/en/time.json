    "description": "In situations where keeping track of the passage of time  is  important,  the  GM  determines  the  time  a  task requires. The GM might use a different time scale depending on the context of the situation at hand. In a  dungeon  environment,  the  adventurers’  movement happens  on  a  scale  of  **minutes**.  It  takes  them  about  a minute to creep down a long hallway, another minute to check for traps on the door at the end of the hall, and a good ten minutes to search the\n\nchamber  beyond  for  anything  interesting  or  valuable.\n\nIn a city or wilderness, a scale of **hours** is often more appropriate. Adventurers eager to reach the lonely  tower  at  the  heart  of  the  forest  hurry  across those fifteen miles in just under four hours’ time.\n\nFor long journeys, a scale of **days** works best. Following  the  road  from  Baldur’s  Gate  to  Waterdeep, the  adventurers  spend four  uneventful  days  before  a goblin ambush interrupts their journey.\n\nIn  combat  and  other  fast-\u00AD‐‑paced  situations,  the game  relies  on  **rounds**,  a  6-\u00AD‐‑second  span  of  time.",
