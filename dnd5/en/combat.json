For example, a fighter who can make two attacks with the  Extra  Attack  feature  and  who  has  a  speed  of  25 feet could move 10 feet, make an attack, move 15 feet, and then attack again.\n\n#### Using  Different  Speeds\n\nIf you have more than one speed, such as your walking speed and a flying speed, you can switch back and forth between your speeds during your move. Whenever you switch, subtract the distance you’ve already moved from the new speed. The result determines how much farther you can move. If  the  result  is  0  or  less,  you  can’t  use  the  new  speed during the current move.\n\nFor example, if you have a speed of 30 and a flying speed  of  60  because  a  wizard  cast  the  _fly_ spell  on  you, you could fly 20 feet, then walk 10 feet, and then leap  into  the  air  to  fly  30  feet  more."

A typical Medium creature  isn’t 5 feet wide, for example, but it does control a  space that wide. If a Medium hobgoblin stands in a 5-\u00AD‐‑  foot-\u00AD‐‑wide  doorway, other creatures can’t get  through unless the hobgoblin lets them.\n\nA creature’s space also reflects the area it needs to fight effectively. For that reason, there’s a limit to the number of creatures that can surround another creature in combat. Assuming Medium combatants, eight creatures can fit in a 5-\u00AD‐‑foot  radius around another one.\n\nBecause larger creatures take up more space, fewer  of  them  can  surround  a  creature.  If  five  Large creatures crowd around a Medium or smaller one, there’s little room for anyone else. In contrast, as many as twenty Medium creatures can surround a Gargantuan one.\n\n#### Squeezing  into  a  Smaller  Space\n\nA creature can squeeze through a space that is large enough for a creature one size smaller than it. Thus, a Large creature can squeeze through a passage that’s only 5 feet wide. While squeezing through a space, a creature must spend 1 extra foot for every foot it moves there, and it has disadvantage on attack  rolls  and  Dexterity  saving  throws.  Attack  rolls against the creature have advantage while it’s in the smaller space."

To do so, you can take the Ready action on your turn, which lets you act using your reaction before the start of your next turn.\n\nFirst, you decide what perceivable circumstance will trigger your reaction. Then, you choose the action you will take in response to that trigger, or you  choose  to  move  up  to  your  speed  in  response  to it. Examples include “If the cultist steps on the trapdoor,  I’ll  pull  the  lever  that  opens  it,”  and “If  the goblin steps next to me, I move away.”\n\nWhen  the  trigger  occurs,  you  can  either  take  your reaction  right  after  the  trigger  finishes  or  ignore  the trigger. Remember that you can take only one reaction per round.\n\nWhen  you  ready  a  spell,  you  cast  it  as  normal  but hold its energy, which you release with your reaction when the trigger occurs. To be readied, a spell must have a casting time of 1 action, and holding onto the spell’s magic requires concentration. If your concentration is broken, the spell  dissipates  without  taking  effect.  For  example,  if you are concentrating on the _web_ spell and ready _magic missile_, your _web_ spell ends, and if you take damage before you release _magic missile_ with your reaction, your concentration might be broken."

Pick a target within your attack’s range: a creature, an object, or a location.\n2. **Determine modifiers**. The GM determines whether the target has cover and whether you have advantage or disadvantage against the target. In addition, spells, special abilities, and other effects can apply penalties or bonuses to your attack roll.\n3. **Resolve the attack**. You make the attack roll. On a hit, you roll damage, unless the particular attack has rules that specify otherwise. Some attacks cause special effects in addition to or instead of damage.\n\nIf there’s ever any question whether something you’re doing counts as an attack, the rule is simple: if you’re making an attack roll, you’re making an attack.",

A monster might shoot spines from its tail.

        "name": "Melee Attacks",
        "content": "Used  in  hand-\u00AD‐‑to-\u00AD‐‑hand  combat,  a  melee  attack  allows you to attack a foe within your reach. A melee attack typically uses a handheld weapon such as a sword, a warhammer, or an axe. A typical monster makes a melee attack when it strikes with its claws, horns, teeth, tentacles, or other body part. A few spells also involve making a melee attack.\n\nMost creatures have a 5-\u00AD‐‑foot  **reach** and can thus attack targets within 5 feet of them when making a melee attack. Certain creatures (typically those  larger than Medium) have melee attacks with a greater reach than 5 feet, as noted in their descriptions.\n\nInstead  of  using  a  weapon  to  make  a  melee weapon attack, you can use an **unarmed strike**: a punch, kick, head-\u00AD‐‑butt,  or similar forceful blow  (none of which count as weapons). On a hit, an  unarmed strike deals bludgeoning damage equal to 1 +  your  Strength  modifier.  You  are  proficient  with your unarmed strikes.\n\n#### Opportunity  Attacks\n\nIn a fight, everyone is constantly watching for a chance  to  strike  an  enemy  who  is  fleeing  or  passing by. Such a strike is called an opportunity attack.\n\nYou can make an opportunity attack when a hostile creature that you can see moves out of your reach.  To  make  the  opportunity  attack,  you  use  your reaction to make one melee attack against the provoking creature. The attack occurs right before the creature leaves your reach.\n\nYou  can  avoid  provoking  an  opportunity  attack  by taking the Disengage action. You also don’t provoke an opportunity attack when you teleport or when someone or something moves you without using your movement, action, or reaction. For example, you don’t provoke an opportunity attack if an explosion hurls you out of a foe’s reach or if gravity causes you to fall past an enemy.\n\n#### Two-Weapon  Fighting\n\nWhen you take the Attack action and attack with a light  melee  weapon  that  you’re  holding  in  one  hand, you  can  use  a  bonus  action  to  attack  with  a  different light melee weapon that you’re holding in the other hand. You don’t add your ability modifier to the damage of the bonus attack, unless that modifier is negative.\n\nIf  either  weapon  has  the  thrown  property,  you  can throw the weapon, instead of making a melee attack with it.\n\n#### Grappling\n\nWhen  you  want  to  grab  a  creature  or  wrestle  with  it, you can use the Attack action to make a special melee attack, a grapple. If you’re able to make multiple attacks with the Attack action, this attack replaces one of them.\n\nThe target of your grapple must be no more than  one size larger than you and must be within your  reach.  Using  at  least  one  free  hand,  you  try  to  seize the target by making a grapple check instead of an attack roll: a Strength (Athletics) check contested by  the target’s Strength (Athletics) or Dexterity (Acrobatics) check (the target chooses the ability to use). If you succeed, you subject the target to the grappled condition (see appendix PH-\u00AD‐‑A).  The condition specifies the things that end it, and you can release the target whenever you like (no action required).\n\n**_Escaping  a  Grapple._** A  grappled  creature  can  use its action to escape. To do so, it must succeed on a Strength  (Athletics)  or  Dexterity  (Acrobatics)  check contested by your Strength (Athletics) check.\n\n**_Moving a Grappled Creature._** When you move,  you  can  drag  or  carry  the  grappled  creature  with  you, but your speed is halved, unless the creature is two  or more sizes smaller than you.\n\n> **Contests  in  Combat**\n> Battle often involves pitting your prowess against that of your foe. Such a challenge is represented by a contest. This section includes the most common contests that require an action  in  combat:  grappling  and  shoving  a  creature.  The  GM can use these contests as models for improvising others.\n\n#### Shoving  a  Creature\n\nUsing the Attack action, you can make a special melee attack to shove a creature, either to knock it prone or push it away from you. If you’re able to make multiple attacks with the Attack action, this attack replaces one of them.\n\nThe target must be no more than one size larger than you and must be within your reach. Instead of making an attack roll, you make a Strength (Athletics) check contested by the target’s Strength (Athletics) or Dexterity (Acrobatics) check (the target chooses the ability to use). If you win the contest, you either knock the target prone or push it 5 feet away from you."

A target can benefit from cover only  when  an  attack  or  other  effect  originates  on  the opposite side of the cover.\n\nThere are three degrees of cover. If a target is behind multiple sources of cover, only the most protective  degree  of  cover  applies;  the  degrees aren’t added together. For example, if a target is behind a creature that gives half cover and a tree  trunk  that  gives  three-\u00AD‐‑quarters  cover,  the  target  has three-\u00AD‐‑quarters  cover.\n\nA  target  with  **half  cover** has  a  +2  bonus  to  AC  and Dexterity  saving  throws.  A  target  has  half  cover  if  an obstacle blocks at least half of its body.  The obstacle might be a low wall, a large piece of furniture, a narrow tree trunk, or a creature, whether that creature is an enemy or a friend.\n\nA target with **three-\u00AD‐‑quarters  cover** has a +5 bonus  to  AC  and  Dexterity  saving  throws.  A  target has three-\u00AD‐‑quarters  cover if about three-\u00AD‐‑quarters  of it is covered by an obstacle. The obstacle might be a portcullis, an arrow slit, or a thick tree trunk.\n\nA target with **total cover** can’t be targeted directly by an attack or a spell, although some spells can  reach such a target by including it in an area of  effect. A target has total cover if it is completely concealed by an obstacle."

This number changes frequently as a creature takes damage or receives healing.\n\nWhenever  a  creature  takes  damage,  that  damage  is subtracted from its hit points.

Magic weapons, special abilities, and other factors can grant a bonus to damage. With a penalty, it is possible to deal 0 damage, but never negative damage.\n\nWhen attacking with a **weapon**, you add your ability modifier—the same modifier used for the attack  roll—to  the  damage.  A  **spell** tells  you  which dice to roll for damage and whether to add any modifiers.\n\nIf a spell or other effect deals damage to **more than one target** at the same time, roll the damage once for all of them. For example, when a wizard casts  _fireball_ or  a  cleric  casts  _flame  strike_,  the  spell’s damage  is  rolled  once  for  all  creatures  caught  in  the blast.\n\n#### Critical  Hits\n\nWhen you score a critical hit, you get to roll extra dice  for  the  attack’s  damage  against  the  target.  Roll all of the attack’s damage dice twice and add them <![endif]-->\n\ntogether. Then add any relevant modifiers as normal. To speed up play, you can roll all the damage dice at once.\n\nFor example, if you score a critical hit with a dagger,  roll  2d4  for  the  damage,  rather  than  1d4,  and then add your relevant ability modifier. If the attack involves  other  damage  dice,  such  as  from the  rogue’s Sneak Attack feature, you roll those dice twice as well.\n\n#### Damage  Types\n\nDifferent  attacks,  damaging  spells,  and  other  harmful effects deal different types of damage. Damage types have no rules of their own, but other rules, such as damage resistance, rely on the types.\n\nThe  damage  types  follow,  with  examples  to  help  a GM assign a damage type to a new effect.\n\n**_Acid._** The corrosive spray of a black dragon’s breath  and  the  dissolving  enzymes  secreted  by  a black pudding deal acid damage.\n\n**_Bludgeoning._** Blunt force attacks—hammers, falling,  constriction,  and  the  like—deal  bludgeoning damage.\n\n**_Cold._** The infernal chill radiating from an ice devil’s  spear  and  the  frigid  blast  of  a  white  dragon’s breath deal cold damage.\n\n**_Fire._** Red  dragons  breathe  fire,  and  many  spells conjure flames to deal fire damage.\n\n**_Force._** Force  is  pure  magical  energy  focused  into  a damaging form. Most effects that deal force damage are spells, including _magic missile_ and _spiritual weapon_.\n\n**_Lightning._** A  _lightning  bolt_ spell  and  a  blue dragon’s breath deal lightning damage.\n\n**_Necrotic._** Necrotic damage, dealt by certain undead  and  a  spell  such  as  _chill  touch_,  withers matter and even the soul.\n\n**_Piercing._** Puncturing and impaling attacks, including  spears  and  monsters’  bites,  deal  piercing damage.\n\n**_Poison._** Venomous  stings  and  the  toxic  gas  of  a green dragon’s breath deal poison damage.\n\n**_Psychic._** Mental  abilities  such  as  a  mind  flayer’s psionic blast deal psychic damage.\n\n**_Radiant._** Radiant  damage,  dealt  by  a  cleric’s  _flame strike_ spell or an angel’s smiting weapon, sears the flesh like fire and overloads the spirit with power.\n\n**_Slashing._** Swords,  axes,  and  monsters’  claws  deal slashing damage.\n\n**_Thunder._** A  concussive  burst  of  sound,  such  as  the effect of the _thunderwave_ spell, deals thunder damage."

If a creature or an object has **vulnerability** to a damage type, damage of that type is doubled against it.\n\nResistance  and  then  vulnerability  are  applied  after all other modifiers to damage. For example, a creature has resistance to bludgeoning damage and is  hit  by  an  attack  that  deals  25  bludgeoning  damage. The creature is also within a magical aura that reduces all damage by 5. The 25 damage is first reduced by 5 and then halved, so the creature takes 10 damage.\n\nMultiple instances of resistance or vulnerability  that affect the same damage type count as only one instance. For example, if a creature has resistance to fire damage as well as resistance to all nonmagical damage, the damage of a nonmagical fire is reduced  by half against the creature, not reduced by three-\u00AD‐‑ quarters."

A creature’s hit points can’t exceed its hit point maximum, so any hit points regained in excess of this number are lost. For example, a druid grants a ranger 8 hit points of healing.

Because the remaining damage equals her hit point maximum, the cleric  dies.\n\n#### Falling Unconscious\n\nIf damage reduces you to 0 hit points and fails to kill you, you fall unconscious (see **Combat=>Condition**).  This unconsciousness ends if you regain any hit points.\n\n#### Death  Saving  Throws\n\nWhenever you start your turn with 0 hit points, you must make a special saving throw, called a death saving  throw,  to  determine  whether  you  creep  closer to death or hang onto life. Unlike other saving throws, this one isn’t tied to any ability score. You  are  in the  hands  of  fate  now,  aided only  by  spells  and features that improve your chances of succeeding on a saving throw.\n\nRoll a d20. If the roll is 10 or higher, you succeed. Otherwise,  you  fail.  A  success  or  failure  has  no  effect by itself. On your third success, you become stable (see below). On your third failure, you die. The successes and failures don’t need to be consecutive; keep track of both until you collect three of a kind. The  number  of  both  is  reset  to  zero  when  you  regain any hit points or become stable.\n\n**_Rolling 1 or 20._** When you make a death saving throw and roll a 1 on the d20, it counts as two failures.  If  you  roll  a  20  on  the  d20,  you  regain  1  hit point.\n\n**_Damage at 0 Hit Points._** If you take any damage while  you  have  0  hit  points,  you  suffer  a  death  saving throw failure. If the damage is from a critical hit, you suffer two failures instead. If the damage equals or exceeds your hit point maximum, you suffer instant death.\n\n#### Stabilizing  a  Creature\n\nThe  best  way  to  save  a  creature  with  0  hit  points  is to  heal  it.  If  healing  is  unavailable,  the  creature  can at  least  be  stabilized  so  that  it  isn’t  killed  by  a  failed death saving throw.\n\nYou  can use  your  action to  administer  first  aid  to an  unconscious  creature  and  attempt  to  stabilize it, which  requires  a  successful  DC  10  Wisdom (Medicine) check.\n\nA **stable** creature doesn’t make death saving throws, even though it has 0 hit points, but it does remain  unconscious.  The  creature  stops  being  stable, and must start making death saving throws again, if it takes any damage. A stable creature that isn’t healed regains 1 hit point after 1d4 hours.\n\n#### Monsters  and  Death\n\nMost  GMs  have  a  monster  die  the  instant  it  drops  to 0 hit points, rather than having it fall unconscious and make death saving throws.\n\nMighty villains and special nonplayer characters are common exceptions; the GM might have them fall  unconscious  and  follow  the  same  rules  as  player characters."

        "content": "A  knight  charging  into  battle  on  a  warhorse,  a  wizard casting spells from the back of a griffon, or a cleric soaring through the sky on a pegasus all enjoy the benefits of speed and mobility that a mount can provide.\n\nA willing creature that is at least one size larger than  you  and  that  has  an  appropriate  anatomy  can serve as a mount, using the following rules.\n\n### Mounting and Dismounting\n\nOnce during your move, you can mount a creature that is within 5 feet of you or dismount. Doing so costs an amount of movement equal to half your speed. For example, if your speed is 30 feet, you must  spend  15  feet  of  movement  to  mount  a  horse. Therefore, you can’t mount it if you don’t have 15 feet of movement left or if your speed is 0.\n\nIf an effect moves your mount against its will while you’re on it, you must succeed on a DC 10 Dexterity  saving  throw or  fall  off  the  mount,  landing prone  in  a  space  within  5  feet  of  it.  If  you’re  knocked prone while mounted, you must make the same saving throw.\n\nIf  your  mount  is  knocked  prone,  you  can  use  your reaction to dismount it as it falls and land on your feet. Otherwise, you are dismounted and fall prone in a space within 5 feet it.\n\n### Controlling  a  Mount\n\nWhile you’re mounted, you have two options. You  can either control the mount or allow it to act independently.  Intelligent  creatures,  such  as  dragons, act independently.\n\nYou  can  control  a  mount  only  if  it  has  been  trained to  accept  a  rider.  Domesticated  horses,  donkeys,  and similar creatures are assumed to have such training. The initiative of a controlled mount changes to match yours when you mount it. It moves as you direct it, and it has only three action options: Dash, Disengage,  and  Dodge.  A  controlled  mount  can  move and act even on the turn that you mount it.\n\nAn independent mount retains its place in the initiative order. Bearing a rider puts no restrictions on  the  actions  the  mount  can  take,  and  it  moves  and acts as it wishes. It might flee from combat, rush to attack  and  devour  a  badly  injured  foe,  or  otherwise act against your wishes."
