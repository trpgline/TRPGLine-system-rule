    "description": "Conditions  alter  a  creature’s  capabilities  in  a  variety of ways and can arise as a result of a spell, a class feature, a monster’s attack, or other effect. Most conditions, such as blinded, are impairments, but a few, such as invisible, can be advantageous.\n\nA  condition  lasts  either  until  it  is  countered  (the prone condition is countered by standing up, for example) or for a duration specified by the effect that imposed the condition.\n\nIf  multiple  effects  impose  the  same  condition  on  a creature, each instance of the condition has its own duration,  but  the  condition’s  effects  don’t  get  worse. A creature either has a condition or doesn’t.\n\nThe  following  definitions  specify  what  happens  to a creature while it is subjected to a condition.",
