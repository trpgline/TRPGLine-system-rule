A spell’s level is a general  indicator  of  how  powerful  it  is,  with  the lowly (but still impressive) _magic missile_ at 1st level and  the  earth-\u00AD‐‑shaking  _wish_ at  9th.  Cantrips—simple but  powerful  spells  that  characters  can  cast  almost by rote—are level 0. The higher a spell’s level, the higher level a spellcaster must be to use that spell.\n\nSpell level and character level don’t correspond directly. Typically, a character has to be at least 17th level, not 9th level, to cast a 9th-\u00AD‐‑level  spell."

Members of a few classes, including bards and sorcerers, have a limited list of spells they know that are always fixed in mind. The same thing is true of many magic-\u00AD‐‑using  monsters. Other spellcasters, such as clerics and wizards,  undergo  a  process  of  preparing  spells.  This process varies for different classes, as detailed in their descriptions.\n\nIn every case, the number of spells a caster can have  fixed  in  mind  at  any  given  time  depends  on  the character’s level."

        "content": "Regardless of how many spells a caster knows or prepares, he or she can cast only a limited number of spells  before  resting.  Manipulating  the  fabric  of magic and channeling its energy into even a simple spell is physically and mentally taxing, and higher-\u00AD‐‑ level spells are even more so. Thus, each spellcasting class’s description (except that of the warlock)  includes  a  table  showing  how  many  spell  slots  of each spell level a character can use at each character level. For example, the 3rd-\u00AD‐‑level  wizard Umara has four  1st-\u00AD‐‑level  spell  slots  and  two  2nd-\u00AD‐‑level  slots.\n\nWhen a character casts a spell, he or she expends a slot  of  that  spell’s  level  or  higher,  effectively  “filling” a slot with the spell. You can think of a spell slot as a groove of a certain size—small for a 1st-\u00AD‐‑level  slot, larger for a spell of higher level. A 1st-\u00AD‐‑level  spell fits into a slot of any size, but a 9th-\u00AD‐‑level  spell fits only in a 9th-\u00AD‐‑level  slot.  So when Umara casts  _magic missile,_ a 1st-\u00AD‐‑level  spell,  she  spends  one  of  her  four  1st-\u00AD‐‑level  slots and has three remaining.\n\nFinishing  a  long  rest  restores  any  expended  spell slots.\n\nSome characters and monsters have special abilities  that  let  them  cast  spells  without  using  spell slots. For example, a monk who follows the Way of the Four Elements, a warlock who chooses certain eldritch invocations, and a pit fiend from the Nine Hells can all cast spells in such a way.\n\n### Casting  a  Spell  at  a  Higher  Level\n\nWhen  a  spellcaster  casts  a  spell  using  a  slot  that  is  of a higher level than the spell, the spell assumes the higher level for that casting. For instance, if Umara casts _magic missile_ using one of her 2nd-\u00AD‐‑level  slots, that _magic missile_ is 2nd level. Effectively, the spell expands to fill the slot it is put into.\n\nSome spells, such as _magic missile_ and _cure wounds_,  have  more  powerful  effects  when  cast  at  a higher level, as detailed in a spell’s description."

It  also  doesn’t  expend  a  spell  slot, which means the ritual version of a spell can’t be cast at a higher level.\n\nTo  cast  a  spell  as  a  ritual,  a  spellcaster  must  have  a feature  that  grants  the  ability  to  do  so.  The  cleric  and the druid, for example, have such a feature.

You  must  use  a  bonus  action  on  your  turn  to  cast  the spell, provided that you haven’t already taken a bonus action this turn. You can’t cast another spell during the same turn, except for a cantrip with a casting time of 1 action.\n\n### Reactions\n\nSome spells can be cast as reactions. These spells take a fraction of a second to bring about and are cast  in  response  to  some  event.  If  a  spell  can  be  cast as  a  reaction,  the  spell  description  tells  you  exactly when you can do so.\n\n### Longer  Casting  Times\n\nCertain spells (including spells cast as rituals) require more time to cast: minutes or even hours. When you cast a spell with a casting time longer  than  a  single  action  or  reaction,  you  must  spend  your action each turn casting the spell, and you must maintain your concentration while you do so (see “Concentration” below).

These spells have a range of self.\n\nSpells that create cones or lines of effect that originate from you also have a range of self, indicating  that  the  origin  point  of  the  spell’s  effect must be you (see “Areas of Effect”).\n\nOnce  a  spell  is  cast,  its  effects  aren’t  limited  by  its range,  unless  the  spell’s  description  says  otherwise."

If  you can’t provide  one  or  more  of  a  spell’s  components,  you  are unable to cast the spell.\n\n### Verbal  (V)\n\nMost spells require the chanting of mystic words.  The  words  themselves  aren’t  the  source  of  the  spell’s power; rather, the particular combination of sounds, with  specific  pitch  and  resonance,  sets  the  threads  of magic in motion. Thus, a character who is gagged or in an area of silence, such as one created by the _silence_ spell, can’t cast a spell with a verbal component.\n\n### Somatic  (S)\n\nSpellcasting gestures might include a forceful gesticulation  or  an  intricate  set  of  gestures.  If  a  spell requires a somatic component, the caster must have free  use  of  at  least  one  hand  to  perform  these  gestures.\n\n### Material (M)\n\nCasting some spells requires particular objects, specified in parentheses in the component entry. A character can use a **component pouch** or a **spellcasting focus** (found in “Equipment”) in place of the components specified for a spell. But if a cost  is indicated for a component, a character must have that  specific  component  before  he  or  she  can  cast  the spell.\n\nIf a spell states that a material component is consumed  by  the  spell,  the  caster  must  provide  this component for each casting of the spell.\n\nA spellcaster must have a hand free to access a spell’s material components—or to hold a spellcasting  focus—but  it  can  be  the  same  hand  that he or she uses to perform somatic components."

Some spells specify that  their  effects  last  until  the  spells  are  dispelled  or destroyed.\n\n### Instantaneous\n\nMany spells are instantaneous. The spell harms, heals, creates, or alters a creature or an object in a way  that  can’t  be  dispelled,  because  its  magic  exists only for an instant.\n\n### Concentration\n\nSome  spells  require  you  to  maintain  concentration  in order to keep their magic active. If you lose concentration, such a spell ends.\n\nIf  a  spell  must  be  maintained  with  concentration, that  fact  appears  in  its  Duration  entry,  and  the  spell specifies how long you can concentrate on it. You can end concentration at any time (no action required).\n\nNormal activity, such as moving and attacking, doesn’t  interfere  with  concentration.  The  following factors can break concentration:\n\n- **Casting another spell that requires concentration.** You lose concentration on a spell if you cast another spell that requires concentration.  You  can’t  concentrate  on  two  spells at once.\n- **Taking damage.** Whenever you take damage while  you  are  concentrating  on  a  spell,  you  must make a Constitution saving throw to maintain  your concentration. The DC equals 10 or half the damage you take, whichever number is higher. If you  take  damage  from  multiple  sources,  such  as  an arrow and a dragon’s breath, you make a separate saving throw for each source of damage.\n- **Being incapacitated or killed.** You lose concentration  on  a  spell  if  you  are  incapacitated  or if you die.\n\nThe GM might also decide that certain environmental phenomena, such as a wave crashing over you while you’re on a storm-\u00AD‐‑tossed  ship, require  you  to  succeed  on  a  DC  10  Constitution saving throw to maintain concentration on a spell."

An effect like crackling lightning is obvious, but a more subtle  effect,  such  as  an  attempt  to  read  a  creature’s thoughts, typically goes unnoticed, unless a spell says otherwise.\n\n### A  Clear  Path  to  the  Target\n\nTo  target  something,  you  must  have  a  clear  path  to  it, so it can’t be behind total cover.\n\nIf  you  place  an  area  of  effect  at  a  point  that  you can’t see and an obstruction, such as a wall, is between you and that point, the point of origin comes  into  being on  the near side  of that obstruction.\n\n### Targeting Yourself\n\nIf a spell targets a creature of your choice, you can choose yourself, unless the creature must be hostile or  specifically  a  creature  other  than  you.

Every area of effect  has a **point of origin**, a location from which the spell’s energy erupts. The rules for each shape specify  how  you  position  its  point  of  origin.

The circle must either be on the ground or at the height of the spell effect. The energy in a cylinder expands in straight lines from the point of origin to the perimeter of the circle, forming the base of the cylinder.

They create magical barriers, negate harmful  effects,  harm trespassers,  or banish creatures to other planes of existence.\n\n**Conjuration** spells involve the transportation of objects and creatures from one location to another. Some spells summon creatures or objects to the caster’s side, whereas others  allow  the  caster  to  teleport  to  another  location.  Some conjurations create objects or effects out of nothing.\n\n**Divination** spells  reveal  information,  whether  in  the  form of secrets long forgotten, glimpses of the future, the locations of hidden things, the truth behind illusions, or visions of distant people or places.\n\n**Enchantment** spells  affect  the  minds  of  others,  influencing or controlling their behavior. Such spells can make enemies see the caster as a friend, force creatures to take a course of action, or even control another creature like a puppet.\n\n**Evocation** spells manipulate magical energy to produce a desired effect.  Some call  up blasts of fire or lightning.  Others channel positive energy to heal wounds.\n\n**Illusion** spells  deceive  the  senses  or  minds  of  others.  They cause people to see things that are not there, to miss things that are there, to hear phantom noises, or to remember things that never happened. Some illusions create phantom images that any creature can see, but the most insidious illusions  plant an image directly in  the mind of  a creature.\n\n**Necromancy** spells manipulate the energies of life and death.
