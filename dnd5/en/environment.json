At  the start of its next turn, it drops to 0 hit points and is dying, and it can’t regain hit points or be stabilized until it can breathe again.\n\nFor  example,  a  creature  with  a  Constitution  of  14 can hold its breath for 3 minutes. If it starts suffocating, it has 2 rounds to reach air before it drops to 0 hit points.",

    "description": "The most fundamental tasks of adventuring— noticing danger, finding hidden objects, hitting an enemy  in  combat,  and  targeting  a  spell,  to  name  just a few—rely heavily on a character’s ability to see.\n\nDarkness  and  other  effects  that  obscure  vision  can prove a significant hindrance.\n\nA given area might be lightly or heavily obscured. In  a  **lightly  obscured** area,  such  as  dim  light,  patchy fog, or moderate foliage, creatures have disadvantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on sight.\n\nA **heavily obscured** area—such as darkness,  opaque  fog,  or  dense  foliage—blocks  vision  entirely. A creature effectively suffers from the blinded condition (see appendix PH-\u00AD‐‑A)  when trying to see something in that area.\n\nThe presence or absence of light in an environment creates three categories of illumination:  bright  light,  dim  light,  and  darkness.\n\n**Bright light** lets most creatures see normally. Even  gloomy  days  provide  bright  light,  as  do  torches,\n\nlanterns,  fires,  and  other  sources  of  illumination within a specific radius.\n\n**Dim light**, also called shadows, creates a lightly obscured area. An area of dim light is usually a boundary  between  a  source  of  bright  light,  such  as  a torch, and surrounding darkness. The soft light of twilight and dawn also counts as dim light. A particularly  brilliant  full  moon  might  bathe  the  land in dim light.\n\n**Darkness** creates a heavily obscured area. Characters face darkness outdoors at night (even most  moonlit  nights),  within  the  confines  of  an  unlit dungeon or a subterranean vault, or in an area of magical darkness.",

    "name": "Interacting with Objects",
    "description": "A character’s interaction with objects in an environment is often simple to resolve in the game. The player tells the GM that his or her character is doing  something,  such  as  moving  a  lever,  and  the  GM describes  what,  if  anything,  happens.\n\nFor example, a character might decide to pull a lever, which might, in turn, raise a portcullis, cause a room to flood with water, or open a secret door in a nearby wall.  If the lever is rusted in position,  though, a  character  might  need  to  force  it.  In  such  a  situation, the GM might call for a Strength check to see  whether the character can wrench the lever into place. The GM sets the DC for any such check based on the difficulty of the task.\n\nCharacters can also damage objects with their weapons and spells. Objects are immune to poison and psychic damage, but otherwise they can be affected by physical and magical attacks much like creatures  can.  The  GM  determines  an  object’s  Armor Class and hit points, and might decide that certain objects  have  resistance  or  immunity  to  certain  kinds of attacks. (It’s hard to cut a rope with a club, for example.)  Objects  always  fail  Strength  and  Dexterity saving throws, and they are immune to effects that require other saves. When an object drops to 0 hit points, it breaks.\n\nA  character  can  also  attempt  a  Strength  check  to break an object. The GM sets the DC for any such check.",
