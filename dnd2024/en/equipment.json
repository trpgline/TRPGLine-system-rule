        "name": "Properties",
        "content": "Here are definitions of the properties in the Properties column of the Weapons table.\n\n### Ammunition\n\nYou can use a weapon that has the Ammunition property to make a ranged attack only if you have ammunition to fire from it. The type of ammunition required is specified with the weapon’s range. Each attack expends one piece of ammunition. Drawing the ammunition is part of the attack (you need a free hand to load a one-handed weapon). After a fight, you can spend 1 minute to recover half the ammunition (round down) you used in the fight; the rest is lost.\n\n### Finesse\n\nWhen making an attack with a Finesse weapon, use your choice of your Strength or Dexterity modifier for the attack and damage rolls. You must use the same modifier for both rolls.\n\n### Heavy\n\nYou have **Disadvantage** on attack rolls with a Heavy weapon if it’s a Melee weapon and your Strength score isn’t at least 13 or if it’s a Ranged weapon and your Dexterity score isn’t at least 13.\n\nImprovised Weapons\n\nIf you use an object—such as a table leg, frying pan, or bottle—as a makeshift weapon, see “**Improvised Weapons**” in the **rules glossary**. Also see those rules if you wield a weapon in an unusual way, such as using a Ranged weapon to make a melee attack.\n\n### Light\n\nWhen you take the **Attack** action on your turn and attack with a Light weapon, you can make one extra attack as a Bonus Action later on the same turn. That extra attack must be made with a different Light weapon, and you don’t add your ability modifier to the extra attack’s damage unless that modifier is negative. For example, you can attack with a **Shortsword** in one hand and a **Dagger** in the other using the **Attack** action and a Bonus Action, but you don’t add your Strength or Dexterity modifier to the damage roll of the Bonus Action unless that modifier is negative.\n\n### Loading\n\nYou can fire only one piece of ammunition from a Loading weapon when you use an action, a Bonus Action, or a Reaction to fire it, regardless of the number of attacks you can normally make.\n\n### Range\n\nA Range weapon has a range in parentheses after the **Ammunition** or **Thrown** property. The range lists two numbers. The first is the weapon’s normal range in feet, and the second is the weapon’s long range. When attacking a target beyond normal range, you have **Disadvantage** on the attack roll. You can’t attack a target beyond the long range.\n\n### Reach\n\nA Reach weapon adds 5 feet to your reach when you attack with it, as well as when determining your reach for **Opportunity Attacks** with it.\n\n### Thrown\n\nIf a weapon has the Thrown property, you can throw the weapon to make a ranged attack, and you can draw that weapon as part of the attack. If the weapon is a Melee weapon, use the same ability modifier for the attack and damage rolls that you use for a melee attack with that weapon.\n\n### Two-Handed\n\nA Two-Handed weapon requires two hands when you attack with it.\n\n### Versatile\n\nA Versatile weapon can be used with one or two hands. A damage value in parentheses appears with the property. The weapon deals that damage when used with two hands to make a melee attack."

The properties are defined below.\n\n### Cleave\n\nIf you hit a creature with a melee attack roll using this weapon, you can make a melee attack roll with the weapon against a second creature within 5 feet of the first that is also within your reach. On a hit, the second creature takes the weapon’s damage, but don’t add your ability modifier to that damage unless that modifier is negative. You can make this extra attack only once per turn.\n\n### Graze\n\nIf your attack roll with this weapon misses a creature, you can deal damage to that creature equal to the ability modifier you used to make the attack roll. This damage is the same type dealt by the weapon, and the damage can be increased only by increasing the ability modifier.\n\n### Nick\n\nWhen you make the extra attack of the **Light** property, you can make it as part of the **Attack** action instead of as a Bonus Action. You can make this extra attack only once per turn.\n\n### Push\n\nIf you hit a creature with this weapon, you can push the creature up to 10 feet straight away from yourself if it is Large or smaller.\n\n### Sap\n\nIf you hit a creature with this weapon, that creature has **Disadvantage** on its next attack roll before the start of your next turn.\n\n### Slow\n\nIf you hit a creature with this weapon and deal damage to it, you can reduce its Speed by 10 feet until the start of your next turn. If the creature is hit more than once by weapons that have this property, the Speed reduction doesn’t exceed 10 feet.\n\n### Topple\n\nIf you hit a creature with this weapon, you can force the creature to make a Constitution saving throw (DC 8 plus the ability modifier used to make the attack roll and your Proficiency Bonus). On a failed save, the creature has the **Prone** condition.\n\n### Vex\n\nIf you hit a creature with this weapon and deal damage to the creature, you have **Advantage** on your next attack roll against that creature before the end of your next turn."

        "content": "The Airborne and Waterborne Vehicles table provides statistics for various types of large vehicles. The following notes apply.\n\n### Speed\n\nA ship sailing against a strong wind moves at half speed. In a dead calm (no wind), waterborne ships can’t move under sail and must be rowed. Keelboats and Rowboats are used on lakes and rivers. If going downstream, add the speed of the current (typically 3 miles per hour) to the speed of the vehicle. These vehicles can’t be rowed against any significant current, but they can be pulled upstream by draft animals on the shores. A Rowboat can be carried and weighs 100 pounds.\n\n### Crew\n\nA ship larger than a Keelboat or Rowboat needs a crew of skilled hirelings (see “**Services**” later in this chapter) to function. The minimum number of skilled hirelings needed to crew a ship depends on the type of ship, as shown in the table.\n\n### Passengers\n\nThe table lists the number of Small and Medium passengers the ship can accommodate using hammocks. A ship outfitted with private accommodations can carry one-fifth as many passengers. A passenger usually pays 5 SP per day for a hammock, but prices can vary from ship to ship. A small private cabin usually costs 2 GP per day.\n\n### Damage Threshold\n\nIf a vehicle has a **damage threshold** (see the **rules glossary**), it’s noted in the table.\n\n### Ship Repair\n\nRepairs to a damaged ship can be made while the vessel is berthed. Repairing 1 Hit Point of damage requires 1 day and costs 20 GP for materials and labor. If the repairs are made in a location where supplies and skilled labor are abundant, such as a city shipyard, the repair time and cost are halved.\n\n### Airborne and Waterborne Vehicles\n\n| Ship | Speed | Crew | Passengers | Cargo (Tons) | AC | HP | Damage Threshold | Cost |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| **Airship** | 8 mph | 10 | 20 | 1 | 13 | 300 | — | 40,000 GP |\n| **Galley** | 4 mph | 80 | — | 150 | 15 | 500 | 20 | 30,000 GP |\n| **Keelboat** | 1 mph | 1 | 6 | 1/2 | 15 | 100 | 10 | 3,000 GP |\n| **Longship** | 3 mph | 40 | 150 | 10 | 15 | 300 | 15 | 10,000 GP |\n| **Rowboat** | 1½ mph | 1 | 3 | — | 11 | 50 | — | 50 GP |\n| **Sailing Ship** | 2 mph | 20 | 20 | 100 | 15 | 300 | 15 | 10,000 GP |\n| **Warship** | 2½ mph | 60 | 60 | 200 | 15 | 500 | 20 | 25,000 GP |"

Handling a magic item is enough to give you a sense that it is extraordinary, but learning a magic item’s properties isn’t automatic.\n\nThe **Identify** spell is the fastest way to reveal an item’s properties. Alternatively, you can focus on one magic item during a **Short Rest** while being in physical contact with the item. At the end of the rest, you learn its properties and how to use them (but not any curse the item might bear).\n\nSometimes a magic item carries a clue to its properties. The command word to activate a ring might be etched inside the band, or a feathered design might hint that it’s a **Ring of Feather Falling**.\n\nWearing or experimenting with an item can also offer hints about its properties. In the specific case of Potions, a little taste is enough to tell the taster what a potion does. Other items might require more experimentation. For example, if your character puts on a **Ring of Swimming**, the DM might say, “Your movement feels strangely fluid.” Perhaps you then dive into a river to see what happens. The DM would then say you swim unexpectedly well."

For example, a magic Shield that requires Attunement provides the benefits of a normal Shield if you aren’t attuned to it, but none of its magical properties.\n\n### Attune during a Short Rest\n\nAttuning to an item requires you to spend a **Short Rest** focused on only that item while being in physical contact with it (this can’t be the same Short Rest used to learn the item’s properties). This focus can take the form of weapon practice (for a Weapon), meditation (for a Wand), or some other appropriate activity. If the Short Rest is interrupted, the Attunement attempt fails. Otherwise, at the end of the Short Rest, you’re attuned to the magic item and can access its full magical capabilities.\n\n### No More Than Three Items\n\nYou can be attuned to no more than three magic items at a time. Any attempt to attune to a fourth item fails; you must end your Attunement to an item first. Additionally, you can’t attune to more than one copy of an item. For example, you can’t attune to more than one **Ring of Protection** at a time.\n\n### Ending Attunement\n\nYour Attunement to an item ends if you no longer satisfy the prerequisites for Attunement, if the item has been more than 100 feet away for at least 24 hours, if you die, or if another creature attunes to the item. You can also voluntarily end Attunement by spending another **Short Rest** focused on the item unless the item is cursed."

A magic item meant to be worn must be donned in the intended fashion: boots go on feet, gloves on hands, hats and helmets on a head, and rings on a finger. Magic armor must be donned, a Shield strapped to the arm, a cloak fastened about the shoulders. A weapon must be held.\n\nIn most cases, a magic item that’s meant to be worn can fit a creature regardless of size or build. Magic garments are made to be easily adjustable, or they magically adjust themselves to the wearer.\n\n### Multiple Items of the Same Kind\n\nYou can’t wear more than one of certain magic items. You can’t normally wear more than one pair of footwear, one pair of gloves or gauntlets, one pair of bracers, one suit of armor, one item of headwear, or one cloak. The DM might make exceptions.\n\n### Paired Items\n\nItems that come in pairs—such as boots, bracers, gauntlets, and gloves—impart their benefits only if both items of the pair are worn. For example, a character wearing a **Boot of Striding and Springing** on one foot and a **Boot of Elvenkind** on the other foot gains no benefit from either."

For example, you need 750 GP of raw materials to make Plate Armor, which sells for 1,500 GP. The DM determines whether appropriate raw materials are available.\n\n### Time\n\nTo determine how many days (working 8 hours a day) it takes to make an item, divide its purchase cost in GP by 10 (round a fraction up to a day). For example, you need 5 days to make a Heavy Crossbow, which sells for 50 GP.\n\nIf an item requires multiple days, the days needn’t be consecutive.\n\nCharacters can combine their efforts to shorten the crafting time.
