A player character’s species is the set of game traits that an adventurer gains from being one of those life forms.\n\nSome species can trace their origin to a single world, plane of existence, or god, while other species first appeared in multiple realms at once. Whatever a species’ genesis, its members have spread across the multiverse and contribute to many different cultures.\n\nMembers of most species live for about 80 years, with exceptions noted in the text about the species in this chapter. Regardless of life span, members of all species reach physical maturity at about the same age. Your character can be any age that isn’t beyond their species’ normal life span.\n\n### Parts of a Species\n\nA species includes the following parts.\n\n**_Creature Type._** A character’s species determines the character’s creature type, which is described in the rules glossary. Every species in this chapter is Humanoid; playable non-Humanoid species appear in other D&D books.\n\n**_Size._** Your character’s species determines the character’s size. Individuals within a species cover a wide range of heights, and some species include such diversity of size that you can choose whether your character is Small or Medium.\n\n**_Speed._** Your character’s species determines the character’s Speed.\n\n**_Special Traits._** Each species gives a character special traits—unique characteristics based on the species’ physiology or magical nature. When you choose a species, your character gets all the special traits listed for it. Some traits involve making a choice from a handful of options."

        "content": "Dwarves were raised from the earth in the elder days by a deity of the forge. Called by various names on different worlds—Moradin, Reorx, and others—that god gave dwarves an affinity for stone and metal and for living underground. The god also made them resilient like the mountains, with a life span of about 350 years.\n\nSquat and often bearded, the original dwarves carved cities and strongholds into mountainsides and under the earth. Their oldest legends tell of conflicts with the monsters of mountaintops and the Underdark, whether those monsters were towering giants or subterranean horrors. Inspired by those tales, dwarves of any culture often sing of valorous deeds—especially of the little overcoming the mighty.\n\nOn some worlds in the multiverse, the first settlements of dwarves were built in hills or mountains, and the families who trace their ancestry to those settlements call themselves hill dwarves or mountain dwarves, respectively. The Greyhawk and Dragonlance settings have such communities.\n\n___\n\n### Dwarf Traits\n\n**Creature Type:** Humanoid\n\n**Size:** Medium (about 4–5 feet tall)\n\n**Speed:** 30 feet\n\nAs a Dwarf, you have these special traits.\n\n**_Darkvision._** You have **Darkvision** with a range of 120 feet.\n\n**_Dwarven Resilience._** You have Resistance to Poison damage.

        "content": "Created by the god Corellon, the first elves could change their forms at will. They lost this ability when Corellon cursed them for plotting with the deity Lolth, who tried and failed to usurp Corellon’s dominion. When Lolth was cast into the Abyss, most elves renounced her and earned Corellon’s forgiveness, but that which Corellon had taken from them was lost forever.\n\nNo longer able to shape-shift at will, the elves retreated to the Feywild, where their sorrow was deepened by that plane’s influence. Over time, curiosity led many of them to explore other planes of existence, including worlds in the Material Plane.\n\nElves have pointed ears and lack facial and body hair. They live for around 750 years, and they don’t sleep but instead enter a trance when they need to rest. In that state, they remain aware of their surroundings while immersing themselves in memories and meditations.\n\nAn environment subtly transforms elves after they inhabit it for a millennium or more, and it grants them certain kinds of magic. Drow, high elves, and wood elves are examples of elves who have been transformed thus.\n\n### Drow\n\nDrow typically dwell in the Underdark and have been shaped by it. Some drow individuals and societies avoid the Underdark altogether yet carry its magic. In the Eberron setting, for example, drow dwell in rainforests and cyclopean ruins on the continent of Xen’drik.\n\n### High Elves\n\nHigh elves have been infused with the magic of crossings between the Feywild and the Material Plane. On some worlds, high elves refer to themselves by other names. For example, they call themselves sun or moon elves in the Forgotten Realms setting, Silvanesti and Qualinesti in the Dragonlance setting, and Aereni in the Eberron setting.\n\n### Wood Elves\n\nWood elves carry the magic of primeval forests within themselves. They are known by many other names, including wild elves, green elves, and forest elves. Grugach are reclusive wood elves of the Greyhawk setting, while the Kagonesti and the Tairnadal are wood elves of the Dragonlance and Eberron settings, respectively.\n\n___\n\n### Elf Traits\n\n**Creature Type:** Humanoid\n\n**Size:** Medium (about 5–6 feet tall)\n\n**Speed:** 30 feet\n\nAs an Elf, you have these special traits.\n\n**_Darkvision._** You have **Darkvision** with a range of 60 feet.\n\n**_Elven Lineage._** You are part of a lineage that grants you supernatural abilities. Choose a lineage from the **Elven Lineages table**. You gain the level 1 benefit of that lineage.\n\nWhen you reach character levels 3 and 5, you learn a higher-level spell, as shown on the table. You always have that spell prepared. You can cast it once without a spell slot, and you regain the ability to cast it in that way when you finish a **Long Rest**. You can also cast the spell using any spell slots you have of the appropriate level. Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma is your spellcasting ability for the spells you cast with this trait (choose the ability when you select the lineage).\n\n**_Fey Ancestry._** You have **Advantage** on saving throws you make to avoid or end the **Charmed** condition.\n\n**_Keen Senses._** You have proficiency in the **Insight**, **Perception**, or **Survival** skill.\n\n**_Trance._** You don’t need to sleep, and magic can’t put you to sleep. You can finish a **Long Rest** in 4 hours if you spend those hours in a trancelike meditation, during which you retain consciousness.\n\n#### Elven Lineages\n\n| Lineage | Level 1 | Level 3 | Level 5 |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Drow | The range of your **Darkvision** increases to 120 feet. You also know the **Dancing Lights** cantrip. | **Faerie Fire** | **Darkness** |\n| High Elf | You know the **Prestidigitation** cantrip. Whenever you finish a **Long Rest**, you can replace that cantrip with a different cantrip from the **Wizard spell list**. | **Detect Magic** | **Misty Step** |\n| Wood Elf | Your Speed increases to 35 feet.

That said, many halflings possess a brave and adventurous spirit that leads them on journeys of discovery, affording them the chance to explore a bigger world and make new friends along the way. Their size—similar to that of a human child—helps them pass through crowds unnoticed and slip through tight spaces.\n\nAnyone who has spent time around halflings, particularly halfling adventurers, has likely witnessed the storied “luck of the halflings” in action. When a halfling is in mortal danger, an unseen force seems to intervene on the halfling’s behalf. Many halflings believe in the power of luck, and they attribute their unusual gift to one or more of their benevolent gods, including Yondalla, Brandobaris, and Charmalaine. The same gift might contribute to their robust life spans (about 150 years).\n\nHalfling communities come in all varieties. For every sequestered shire tucked away in an unspoiled part of the world, there’s a crime syndicate like the Boromar Clan in the Eberron setting or a territorial mob of halflings like those in the Dark Sun setting.\n\nHalflings who prefer to live underground are sometimes called strongheart halflings or stouts. Nomadic halflings, as well as those who live among humans and other tall folk, are sometimes called lightfoot halflings or tallfellows.\n\n___\n\n### Halfling Traits\n\n**Creature Type:** Humanoid\n\n**Size:** Small (about 2–3 feet tall)\n\n**Speed:** 30 feet\n\nAs a Halfling, you have these special traits.\n\n**_Brave._** You have **Advantage** on saving throws you make to avoid or end the **Frightened** condition.\n\n**_Halfling Nimbleness._** You can move through the space of any creature that is a size larger than you, but you can’t stop in the same space.\n\n**_Luck._** When you roll a 1 on the d20 of a **D20 Test**, you can reroll the die, and you must use the new roll.\n\n**_Naturally Stealthy._** You can take the **Hide** action even when you are obscured only by a creature that is at least one size larger than you."
