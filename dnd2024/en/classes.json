See chapter 7 for the rules on spellcasting. The information below details how you use those rules with Cleric spells, which appear on the Cleric spell list later in the class’s description.\n\n**_Cantrips._** You know three cantrips of your choice from the Cleric spell list. **Guidance**, **Sacred Flame**, and **Thaumaturgy** are recommended.\n\nWhenever you gain a Cleric level, you can replace one of your cantrips with another cantrip of your choice from the Cleric spell list.\n\nWhen you reach Cleric levels 4 and 10, you learn another cantrip of your choice from the Cleric spell list, as shown in the Cantrips column of the Cleric Features table.\n\n**_Spell Slots._** The Cleric Features table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your level 1+ spells. You regain all expended slots when you finish a **Long Rest**.\n\n**_Prepared Spells of Level 1+._** You prepare the list of level 1+ spells that are available for you to cast with this feature. To start, choose four level 1 spells from the Cleric spell list. **Bless**, **Cure Wounds**, **Guiding Bolt**, and **Shield of Faith** are recommended.\n\nThe number of spells on your list increases as you gain Cleric levels, as shown in the Prepared Spells column of the Cleric Features table. Whenever that number increases, choose additional spells from the Cleric spell list until the number of spells on your list matches the number on the table. The chosen spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots. For example, if you’re a level 3 Cleric, your list of prepared spells can include six spells of levels 1 and 2 in any combination.\n\nIf another Cleric feature gives you spells that you always have prepared, those spells don’t count against the number of spells you can prepare with this feature, but those spells otherwise count as Cleric spells for you.\n\n**_Changing Your Prepared Spells._** Whenever you finish a **Long Rest**, you can change your list of prepared spells, replacing any of the spells there with other Cleric spells for which you have spell slots.\n\n**_Spellcasting Ability._** Wisdom is your spellcasting ability for your Cleric spells.\n\n**_Spellcasting Focus._** You can use a **Holy Symbol** as a Spellcasting Focus for your Cleric spells.\n\n#### Level 1: Divine Order\n\nYou have dedicated yourself to one of the following sacred roles of your choice.\n\n**_Protector._** Trained for battle, you gain proficiency with Martial weapons and training with Heavy armor.\n\n**_Thaumaturge._** You know one extra cantrip from the Cleric spell list. In addition, your mystical connection to the divine gives you a bonus to your Intelligence (**Arcana** or **Religion**) checks. The bonus equals your Wisdom modifier (minimum of +1).\n\n#### Level 2: Channel Divinity\n\nYou can channel divine energy directly from the Outer Planes to fuel magical effects. You start with two such effects: Divine Spark and Turn Undead, each of which is described below. Each time you use this class’s Channel Divinity, choose which Channel Divinity effect from this class to create. You gain additional effect options at higher Cleric levels.\n\nYou can use this class’s Channel Divinity twice. You regain one of its expended uses when you finish a **Short Rest**, and you regain all expended uses when you finish a **Long Rest**. You gain additional uses when you reach certain Cleric levels, as shown in the Channel Divinity column of the Cleric Features table.\n\nIf a Channel Divinity effect requires a saving throw, the DC equals the spell save DC from this class’s Spellcasting feature.\n\n**_Divine Spark._** As a **Magic** action, you point your Holy Symbol at another creature you can see within 30 feet of yourself and focus divine energy at it. Roll 1d8 and add your Wisdom modifier. You either restore Hit Points to the creature equal to that total or force the creature to make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes Necrotic or Radiant damage (your choice) equal to that total. On a successful save, the creature takes half as much damage (round down).\n\nYou roll an additional d8 when you reach Cleric levels 7 (2d8), 13 (3d8), and 18 (4d8).\n\n**_Turn Undead._** As a **Magic** action, you present your Holy Symbol and censure Undead creatures. Each Undead of your choice within 30 feet of you must make a Wisdom saving throw. If the creature fails its save, it has the **Frightened** and **Incapacitated** conditions for 1 minute. For that duration, it tries to move as far from you as it can on its turns. This effect ends early on the creature if it takes any damage, if you have the Incapacitated condition, or if you die.\n\n#### Level 3: Cleric Subclass\n\nYou gain a Cleric subclass of your choice. The Life Domain subclass is detailed after this class’s description. A subclass is a specialization that grants you features at certain Cleric levels. For the rest of your career, you gain each of your subclass’s features that are of your Cleric level or lower.\n\n#### Level 4: Ability Score Improvement\n\nYou gain the Ability Score Improvement feat (see chapter 5) or another feat of your choice for which you qualify. You gain this feature again at Cleric levels 8, 12, and 16.\n\n#### Level 5: Sear Undead\n\nWhenever you use Turn Undead, you can roll a number of d8s equal to your Wisdom modifier (minimum of 1d8) and add the rolls together. Each Undead that fails its saving throw against that use of Turn Undead takes Radiant damage equal to the roll’s total. This damage doesn’t end the turn effect.\n\n#### Level 7: Blessed Strikes\n\nDivine power infuses you in battle. You gain one of the following options of your choice (if you get either option from a Cleric subclass in an older book, use only the option you choose for this feature).\n\n**_Divine Strike._** Once on each of your turns when you hit a creature with an attack roll using a weapon, you can cause the target to take an extra 1d8 Necrotic or Radiant damage (your choice).\n\n**_Potent Spellcasting._** Add your Wisdom modifier to the damage you deal with any Cleric cantrip.\n\n#### Level 10: Divine Intervention\n\nYou can call on your deity or pantheon to intervene on your behalf. As a **Magic** action, choose any Cleric spell of level 5 or lower that doesn’t require a Reaction to cast. As part of the same action, you cast that spell without expending a spell slot or needing Material components. You can’t use this feature again until you finish a **Long Rest**.\n\n#### Level 14: Improved Blessed Strikes\n\nThe option you chose for Blessed Strikes grows more powerful.\n\n**_Divine Strike._** The extra damage of your Divine Strike increases to 2d8.\n\n**_Potent Spellcasting._** When you cast a Cleric cantrip and deal damage to a creature with it, you can give vitality to yourself or another creature within 60 feet of yourself, granting a number of **Temporary Hit Points** equal to twice your Wisdom modifier.\n\n#### Level 19: Epic Boon\n\nYou gain an Epic Boon feat (see chapter 5) or another feat of your choice for which you qualify. Boon of Fate is recommended.\n\n#### Level 20: Greater Divine Intervention\n\nYou can call on even more powerful divine intervention. When you use your Divine Intervention feature, you can choose **Wish** when you select a spell. If you do so, you can’t use Divine Intervention again until you finish 2d4 **Long Rests**."

        "name": "Cleric Subclass",
        "content": "A Cleric subclass is a specialization that grants you features at certain Cleric levels, as specified in the subclass. Each Cleric subclass is named after a domain of existence that is favored by a god, pantheon, or religious order. This section presents the Life Domain subclass.\n\n#### Life Domain\n\n_Soothe the Hurts of the World_\n\nThe Life Domain focuses on the positive energy that helps sustain all life in the multiverse. Clerics who tap into this domain are masters of healing, using that life force to cure many hurts.\n\nExistence itself relies on the positive energy associated with this domain, so a Cleric of almost any religious tradition might choose it. This domain is particularly associated with agricultural deities, gods of healing or endurance, and gods of home and community. Religious orders of healing also seek the magic of this domain.\n\n##### Level 3: Disciple of Life\n\nWhen a spell you cast with a spell slot restores Hit Points to a creature, that creature regains additional Hit Points on the turn you cast the spell. The additional Hit Points equal 2 plus the spell slot’s level.\n\n##### Level 3: Life Domain Spells\n\nYour connection to this divine domain ensures you always have certain spells ready. When you reach a Cleric level specified in the Life Domain Spells table, you thereafter always have the listed spells prepared.\n\n##### Life Domain Spells\n\n| Cleric Level | Prepared Spells |\n| --- | --- |\n| 3 | Aid, Bless, Cure Wounds, Lesser Restoration |\n| 5 | Mass Healing Word, Revivify |\n| 7 | Aura of Life, Death Ward |\n| 9 | Greater Restoration, Mass Cure Wounds |\n\n##### Level 3: Preserve Life\n\nAs a **Magic** action, you present your Holy Symbol and expend a use of your Channel Divinity to evoke healing energy that can restore a number of Hit Points equal to five times your Cleric level. Choose **Bloodied** creatures within 30 feet of yourself (which can include you), and divide those Hit Points among them. This feature can restore a creature to no more than half its Hit Point maximum.\n\n##### Level 6: Blessed Healer\n\nThe healing spells you cast on others heal you as well. Immediately after you cast a spell with a spell slot that restores Hit Points to one or more creatures other than yourself, you regain Hit Points equal to 2 plus the spell slot’s level.\n\n##### Level 17: Supreme Healing\n\nWhen you would normally roll one or more dice to restore Hit Points to a creature with a spell or Channel Divinity, don’t roll those dice for the healing; instead use the highest number possible for each die. For example, instead of restoring 2d6 Hit Points to a creature with a spell, you restore 12."

As a Bonus Action, you can use it to regain Hit Points equal to 1d10 plus your Fighter level.\n\nYou can use this feature twice. You regain one expended use when you finish a **Short Rest**, and you regain all expended uses when you finish a **Long Rest**.\n\nWhen you reach certain Fighter levels, you gain more uses of this feature, as shown in the Second Wind column of the Fighter Features table.\n\n#### Level 1: Weapon Mastery\n\nYour training with weapons allows you to use the mastery properties of three kinds of Simple or Martial weapons of your choice. Whenever you finish a Long Rest, you can practice weapon drills and change one of those weapon choices.\n\nWhen you reach certain Fighter levels, you gain the ability to use the mastery properties of more kinds of weapons, as shown in the Weapon Mastery column of the Fighter Features table.\n\n#### Level 2: Action Surge\n\nYou can push yourself beyond your normal limits for a moment. On your turn, you can take one additional action, except the **Magic** action.\n\nOnce you use this feature, you can’t do so again until you finish a **Short** or **Long Rest**. Starting at level 17, you can use it twice before a rest but only once on a turn.\n\n#### Level 2: Tactical Mind\n\nYou have a mind for tactics on and off the battlefield. When you fail an ability check, you can expend a use of your Second Wind to push yourself toward success. Rather than regaining Hit Points, you roll 1d10 and add the number rolled to the ability check, potentially turning it into a success. If the check still fails, this use of Second Wind isn’t expended.\n\n#### Level 3: Fighter Subclass\n\nYou gain a Fighter subclass of your choice. The Champion subclass is detailed after this class’s description. A subclass is a specialization that grants you features at certain Fighter levels. For the rest of your career, you gain each of your subclass’s features that are of your Fighter level or lower.\n\n#### Level 4: Ability Score Improvement\n\nYou gain the Ability Score Improvement feat (see chapter 5) or another feat of your choice for which you qualify. You gain this feature again at Fighter levels 6, 8, 12, 14, and 16.\n\n#### Level 5: Extra Attack\n\nYou can attack twice instead of once whenever you take the **Attack** action on your turn.\n\n#### Level 5: Tactical Shift\n\nWhenever you activate your Second Wind with a Bonus Action, you can move up to half your Speed without provoking **Opportunity Attacks**.\n\n#### Level 9: Indomitable\n\nIf you fail a saving throw, you can reroll it with a bonus equal to your Fighter level. You must use the new roll, and you can’t use this feature again until you finish a **Long Rest**.\n\nYou can use this feature twice before a Long Rest starting at level 13 and three times before a Long Rest starting at level 17.\n\n#### Level 9: Tactical Master\n\nWhen you attack with a weapon whose mastery property you can use, you can replace that property with the Push, Sap, or **Slow** property for that attack.\n\n#### Level 11: Two Extra Attacks\n\nYou can attack three times instead of once whenever you take the **Attack** action on your turn.\n\n#### Level 13: Studied Attacks\n\nYou study your opponents and learn from each attack you make. If you make an attack roll against a creature and miss, you have Advantage on your next attack roll against that creature before the end of your next turn.\n\n#### Level 19: Epic Boon\n\nYou gain an Epic Boon feat (see chapter 5) or another feat of your choice for which you qualify. Boon of Combat Prowess is recommended.\n\n#### Level 20: Three Extra Attacks\n\nYou can attack four times instead of once whenever you take the Attack action on your turn."

    "description": "Rogues rely on cunning, stealth, and their foes’ vulnerabilities to get the upper hand in any situation. They have a knack for finding the solution to just about any problem. A few even learn magical tricks to supplement their other abilities. Many Rogues focus on stealth and deception, while others refine skills that help them in a dungeon environment, such as climbing, finding and disarming traps, and opening locks.\n\nIn combat, Rogues prioritize subtle strikes over brute strength. They would rather make one precise strike than wear an opponent down with a barrage of blows.\n\nSome Rogues began their careers as criminals, while others used their cunning to fight crime.

Once per turn, you can deal an extra 1d6 damage to one creature you hit with an attack roll if you have **Advantage** on the roll and the attack uses a Finesse or a Ranged weapon. The extra damage’s type is the same as the weapon’s type.\n\nYou don’t need **Advantage** on the attack roll if at least one of your allies is within 5 feet of the target, the ally doesn’t have the **Incapacitated** condition, and you don’t have **Disadvantage** on the attack roll.\n\nThe extra damage increases as you gain Rogue levels, as shown in the Sneak Attack column of the Rogue Features table.\n\n#### Level 1: Thieves’ Cant\n\nYou picked up various languages in the communities where you plied your roguish talents. You know Thieves’ Cant and one other language of your choice, which you choose from the language tables in chapter 2.\n\n#### Level 1: Weapon Mastery\n\nYour training with weapons allows you to use the mastery properties of two kinds of weapons of your choice with which you have proficiency, such as Daggers and Shortbows.\n\nWhenever you finish a **Long Rest**, you can change the kinds of weapons you chose. For example, you could switch to using the mastery properties of Scimitars and Shortswords.\n\n#### Level 2: Cunning Action\n\nYour quick thinking and agility allow you to move and act quickly. On your turn, you can take one of the following actions as a Bonus Action: **Dash**, **Disengage**, or **Hide**.\n\n#### Level 3: Rogue Subclass\n\nYou gain a Rogue subclass of your choice. The Arcane Trickster, Assassin, Soulknife, and Thief subclasses are detailed after this class’s description. A subclass is a specialization that grants you features at certain Rogue levels. For the rest of your career, you gain each of your subclass’s features that are of your Rogue level or lower.\n\n#### Level 3: Steady Aim\n\nAs a Bonus Action, you give yourself **Advantage** on your next attack roll on the current turn. You can use this feature only if you haven’t moved during this turn, and after you use it, your Speed is 0 until the end of the current turn.\n\n#### Level 4: Ability Score Improvement\n\nYou gain the Ability Score Improvement feat (see chapter 5) or another feat of your choice for which you qualify. You gain this feature again at Rogue levels 8, 10, 12, and 16.\n\n#### Level 5: Cunning Strike\n\nYou’ve developed cunning ways to use your Sneak Attack. When you deal Sneak Attack damage, you can add one of the following Cunning Strike effects. Each effect has a die cost, which is the number of Sneak Attack damage dice you must forgo to add the effect. You remove the die before rolling, and the effect occurs immediately after the attack’s damage is dealt. For example, if you add the Poison effect, remove 1d6 from the Sneak Attack’s damage before rolling.\n\nIf a Cunning Strike effect requires a saving throw, the DC equals 8 plus your Dexterity modifier and Proficiency Bonus.\n\n**_Poison (Cost: 1d6)._** You add a toxin to your strike, forcing the target to make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the target has the **Poisoned** condition for 1 minute. At the end of each of its turns, the Poisoned target repeats the save, ending the effect on itself on a success.\n\nTo use this effect, you must have a **Poisoner’s Kit** on your person.\n\n**_Trip (Cost: 1d6)._** If the target is Large or smaller, it must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or have the Prone condition.\n\n**_Withdraw (Cost: 1d6)._** Immediately after the attack, you move up to half your Speed without provoking **Opportunity Attacks**.\n\n#### Level 5: Uncanny Dodge\n\nWhen an attacker that you can see hits you with an attack roll, you can take a Reaction to halve the attack’s damage against you (round down).\n\n#### Level 7: Evasion\n\nYou can nimbly dodge out of the way of certain dangers. When you’re subjected to an effect that allows you to make a Dexterity saving throw to take only half damage, you instead take no damage if you succeed on the saving throw and only half damage if you fail. You can’t use this feature if you have the **Incapacitated** condition.\n\n#### Level 7: Reliable Talent\n\nWhenever you make an ability check that uses one of your skill or tool proficiencies, you can treat a d20 roll of 9 or lower as a 10.\n\n#### Level 11: Improved Cunning Strike\n\nYou can use up to two Cunning Strike effects when you deal Sneak Attack damage, paying the die cost for each effect.\n\n#### Level 14: Devious Strikes\n\nYou’ve practiced new ways to use your Sneak Attack deviously. The following effects are now among your Cunning Strike options.\n\n**_Daze (Cost: 2d6)._** The target must succeed on a Constitution saving throw, or on its next turn, it can do only one of the following: move or take an action or a Bonus Action.\n\n**_Knock Out (Cost: 6d6)._** The target must succeed on a Constitution saving throw, or it has the **Unconscious** condition for 1 minute or until it takes any damage. The Unconscious target repeats the save at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.\n\n**_Obscure (Cost: 3d6)._** The target must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw, or it has the **Blinded** condition until the end of its next turn.\n\n#### Level 15: Slippery Mind\n\nYour cunning mind is exceptionally difficult to control. You gain proficiency in Wisdom and Charisma saving throws.\n\n#### Level 18: Elusive\n\nYou’re so evasive that attackers rarely gain the upper hand against you. No attack roll can have **Advantage** against you unless you have the **Incapacitated** condition.\n\n#### Level 19: Epic Boon\n\nYou gain an Epic Boon feat (see chapter 5) or another feat of your choice for which you qualify. Boon of the Night Spirit is recommended.\n\n#### Level 20: Stroke of Luck\n\nYou have a marvelous knack for succeeding when you need to. If you fail a **D20 Test**, you can turn the roll into a 20.\n\nOnce you use this feature, you can’t use it again until you finish a **Short** or **Long Rest**."

On a roll of 6, you use the property without expending the charges.\n\n**_Scrolls._** You can use any **Spell Scroll**, using Intelligence as your spellcasting ability for the spell. If the spell is a cantrip or a level 1 spell, you can cast it reliably. If the scroll contains a higher-level spell, you must first succeed on an Intelligence (**Arcana**) check (DC 10 plus the spell’s level). On a successful check, you cast the spell from the scroll.

    "description": "Wizards are defined by their exhaustive study of magic’s inner workings. They cast spells of explosive fire, arcing lightning, subtle deception, and spectacular transformations. Their magic conjures monsters from other planes of existence, glimpses the future, or forms protective barriers. Their mightiest spells change one substance into another, call meteors from the sky, or open portals to other worlds.\n\nMost Wizards share a scholarly approach to magic. They examine the theoretical underpinnings of magic, particularly the categorization of spells into schools of magic. Renowned Wizards such as Bigby, Tasha, Mordenkainen, and Yolande have built on their studies to invent iconic spells now used across the multiverse.\n\nThe closest a Wizard is likely to come to an ordinary life is working as a sage or lecturer. Other Wizards sell their services as advisers, serve in military forces, or pursue lives of crime or domination.\n\nBut the lure of knowledge calls even the most unadventurous Wizards from the safety of their libraries and laboratories and into crumbling ruins and lost cities. Most Wizards believe that their counterparts in ancient civilizations knew secrets of magic that have been lost to the ages, and discovering those secrets could unlock the path to a power greater than any magic available in the present age.",

See chapter 7 for the rules on spellcasting. The information below details how you use those rules with Wizard spells, which appear in the Wizard spell list later in the class’s description.\n\n**_Cantrips._** You know three Wizard cantrips of your choice. **Light**, **Mage Hand**, and **Ray of Frost** are recommended. Whenever you finish a **Long Rest**, you can replace one of your cantrips from this feature with another Wizard cantrip of your choice.\n\nWhen you reach Wizard levels 4 and 10, you learn another Wizard cantrip of your choice, as shown in the Cantrips column of the Wizard Features table.\n\n**_Spellbook._** Your wizardly apprenticeship culminated in the creation of a unique book: your spellbook. It is a Tiny object that weighs 3 pounds, contains 100 pages, and can be read only by you or someone casting **Identify**. You determine the book’s appearance and materials, such as a gilt-edged tome or a collection of vellum bound with twine.\n\nThe book contains the level 1+ spells you know. It starts with six level 1 Wizard spells of your choice. **Detect Magic**, **Feather Fall**, **Mage Armor**, **Magic Missile**, **Sleep**, and **Thunderwave** are recommended.\n\nWhenever you gain a Wizard level after 1, add two Wizard spells of your choice to your spellbook. Each of these spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots, as shown in the Wizard Features table. The spells are the culmination of arcane research you do regularly.\n\n**_Spell Slots._** The Wizard Features table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your level 1+ spells. You regain all expended slots when you finish a **Long Rest**.\n\n**_Prepared Spells of Level 1+._** You prepare the list of level 1+ spells that are available for you to cast with this feature. To do so, choose four spells from your spellbook. The chosen spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots.\n\nThe number of spells on your list increases as you gain Wizard levels, as shown in the Prepared Spells column of the Wizard Features table. Whenever that number increases, choose additional Wizard spells until the number of spells on your list matches the number in the table. The chosen spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots. For example, if you’re a level 3 Wizard, your list of prepared spells can include six spells of levels 1 and 2 in any combination, chosen from your spellbook.\n\nIf another Wizard feature gives you spells that you always have prepared, those spells don’t count against the number of spells you can prepare with this feature, but those spells otherwise count as Wizard spells for you.\n\n**_Changing Your Prepared Spells._** Whenever you finish a **Long Rest**, you can change your list of prepared spells, replacing any of the spells there with spells from your spellbook.\n\n**_Spellcasting Ability._** Intelligence is your spellcasting ability for your Wizard spells.\n\n**_Spellcasting Focus._** You can use an **Arcane Focus** or your **spellbook** as a Spellcasting Focus for your Wizard spells.\n\n\n>**Expanding and Replacing a Spellbook**\n>\n>The spells you add to your spellbook as you gain levels reflect your ongoing magical research, but you might find other spells during your adventures that you can add to the book. You could discover a Wizard spell on a **Spell Scroll**, for example, and then copy it into your spellbook.\n>\n>**_Copying a Spell into the Book._** When you find a level 1+ Wizard spell, you can copy it into your spellbook if it’s of a level you can prepare and if you have time to copy it. For each level of the spell, the transcription takes 2 hours and costs 50 GP. Afterward you can prepare the spell like the other spells in your spellbook.\n>\n>**_Copying the Book._** You can copy a spell from your spellbook into another book. This is like copying a new spell into your spellbook but faster, since you already know how to cast the spell. You need spend only 1 hour and 10 GP for each level of the copied spell.\n>\n>If you lose your spellbook, you can use the same procedure to transcribe the Wizard spells that you have prepared into a new spellbook. Filling out the remainder of the new book requires you to find new spells to do so. For this reason, many wizards keep a backup spellbook.\n\n#### Level 1: Ritual Adept\n\nYou can cast any spell as a Ritual if that spell has the Ritual tag and the spell is in your spellbook. You needn’t have the spell prepared, but you must read from the book to cast a spell in this way.\n\n#### Level 1: Arcane Recovery\n\nYou can regain some of your magical energy by studying your spellbook. When you finish a **Short Rest**, you can choose expended spell slots to recover. The spell slots can have a combined level equal to no more than half your Wizard level (round up), and none of the slots can be level 6 or higher. For example, if you’re a level 4 Wizard, you can recover up to two levels’ worth of spell slots, regaining either one level 2 spell slot or two level 1 spell slots.\n\nOnce you use this feature, you can’t do so again until you finish a **Long Rest**.\n\n#### Level 2: Scholar\n\nWhile studying magic, you also specialized in another field of study. Choose one of the following skills in which you have proficiency: **Arcana**, **History**, **Investigation**, **Medicine**, **Nature**, or **Religion**. You have **Expertise** in the chosen skill.\n\n#### Level 3: Wizard Subclass\n\nYou gain a Wizard subclass of your choice. The Evoker subclass is detailed after this class’s description. A subclass is a specialization that grants you features at certain Wizard levels. For the rest of your career, you gain each of your subclass’s features that are of your Wizard level or lower.\n\n#### Level 4: Ability Score Improvement\n\nYou gain the Ability Score Improvement feat (see chapter 5) or another feat of your choice for which you qualify. You gain this feature again at Wizard levels 8, 12, and 16.\n\n#### Level 5: Memorize Spell\n\nWhenever you finish a **Short Rest**, you can study your spellbook and replace one of the level 1+ Wizard spells you have prepared for your Spellcasting feature with another level 1+ spell from the book.\n\n#### Level 18: Spell Mastery\n\nYou have achieved such mastery over certain spells that you can cast them at will. Choose a level 1 and a level 2 spell in your spellbook that have a casting time of an action. You always have those spells prepared, and you can cast them at their lowest level without expending a spell slot. To cast either spell at a higher level, you must expend a spell slot.\n\nWhenever you finish a **Long Rest**, you can study your spellbook and replace one of those spells with an eligible spell of the same level from the book.\n\n#### Level 19: Epic Boon\n\nYou gain an Epic Boon feat (see chapter 5) or another feat of your choice for which you qualify. Boon of Spell Recall is recommended.\n\n#### Level 20: Signature Spells\n\nChoose two level 3 spells in your spellbook as your signature spells. You always have these spells prepared, and you can cast each of them once at level 3 without expending a spell slot. When you do so, you can’t cast them in this way again until you finish a **Short** or **Long Rest**. To cast either spell at a higher level, you must expend a spell slot."

        "name": "Wizard Subclass",
        "content": "A Wizard subclass is a specialization that grants you features at certain Wizard levels, as specified in the subclass. This section presents the Evoker subclass.\n\n#### Evoker\n\n_Create Explosive Elemental Effects_\n\nYour studies focus on magic that creates powerful elemental effects such as bitter cold, searing flame, rolling thunder, crackling lightning, and burning acid. Some Evokers find employment in military forces, serving as artillery to blast armies from afar. Others use their power to protect others, while some seek their own gain.\n\n##### Level 3: Evocation Savant\n\nChoose two Wizard spells from the Evocation school, each of which must be no higher than level 2, and add them to your spellbook for free.\n\nIn addition, whenever you gain access to a new level of spell slots in this class, you can add one Wizard spell from the Evocation school to your spellbook for free. The chosen spell must be of a level for which you have spell slots.\n\n##### Level 3: Potent Cantrip\n\nYour damaging cantrips affect even creatures that avoid the brunt of the effect. When you cast a cantrip at a creature and you miss with the attack roll or the target succeeds on a saving throw against the cantrip, the target takes half the cantrip’s damage (if any) but suffers no additional effect from the cantrip.\n\n##### Level 6: Sculpt Spells\n\nYou can create pockets of relative safety within the effects of your evocations. When you cast an Evocation spell that affects other creatures that you can see, you can choose a number of them equal to 1 plus the spell’s level. The chosen creatures automatically succeed on their saving throws against the spell, and they take no damage if they would normally take half damage on a successful save.\n\n##### Level 10: Empowered Evocation\n\nWhenever you cast a Wizard spell from the Evocation school, you can add your Intelligence modifier to one damage roll of that spell.\n\n##### Level 14: Overchannel\n\nYou can increase the power of your spells. When you cast a Wizard spell with a spell slot of levels 1–5 that deals damage, you can deal maximum damage with that spell on the turn you cast it.\n\nThe first time you do so, you suffer no adverse effect. If you use this feature again before you finish a Long Rest, you take 2d12 Necrotic damage for each level of the spell slot immediately after you cast it. This damage ignores Resistance and Immunity.\n\nEach time you use this feature again before finishing a Long Rest, the Necrotic damage per spell level increases by 1d12."
