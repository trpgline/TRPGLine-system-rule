These rolls are called D20 Tests, and they come in three kinds: ability checks, saving throws, and attack rolls. They follow these steps:\n\n1. **Roll 1d20**. You always want to roll high. If the roll has Advantage or Disadvantage (described later in this chapter), you roll two d20s, but you use the number from only one of them—the higher one if you have Advantage or the lower one if you have Disadvantage.\n2. **Add Modifiers**. Add these modifiers to the number rolled on the d20:\n    - **The Relevant Ability Modifier**. This chapter and the rules glossary explain which ability modifiers to use for various D20 Tests.\n    - **Your Proficiency Bonus If Relevant**. Each creature has a Proficiency Bonus, a number added when making a D20 Test that uses something, such as a skill, in which the creature has proficiency. See “Proficiency” later in this chapter.\n     - **Circumstantial Bonuses and Penalties**. A class feature, a spell, or another rule might give a bonus or penalty to the die roll.\n3. **Compare the Total to a Target Number**. If the total of the d20 and its modifiers equals or exceeds the target number, the D20 Test succeeds. Otherwise, it fails. The Dungeon Master determines target numbers and tells players whether their rolls are successful. The target number for an ability check or a saving throw is called a Difficulty Class (DC). The target number for an attack roll is called an Armor Class (AC), which appears on a character sheet or in a stat block (see the rules glossary).",

        "content": "An ability check represents a creature using talent and training to try to overcome a challenge, such as forcing open a stuck door, picking a lock, entertaining a crowd, or deciphering a cipher. The DM and the rules often call for an ability check when a creature attempts something other than an attack that has a chance of meaningful failure. When the outcome is uncertain and narratively interesting, the dice determine the result.\n\n### Ability Modifier\n\nAn ability check is named for the ability modifier it uses: a Strength check, an Intelligence check, and so on. Different ability checks are called for in different situations, depending on which ability is most relevant. See the Ability Check Examples table for examples of each check’s use.\n\n#### Ability Check Examples\n| Ability      | Make a Check To...                                         |\n| ------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------- |\n| Strength     | Lift, push, pull, or break something                       |\n| Dexterity    | Move nimbly, quickly, or quietly                           |\n| Constitution | Push your body beyond normal limits                        |\n| Intelligence | Reason or remember                                         |\n| Wisdom       | Notice things in the environment or in creatures’ behavior |\n| Charisma     | Influence, entertain, or deceive                           |\n\n### Proficiency Bonus\n\nAdd your Proficiency Bonus to an ability check when the DM determines that a skill or tool proficiency is relevant to the check and you have that proficiency. For example, if a rule refers to a Strength (Acrobatics or Athletics) check, you can add your Proficiency Bonus to the check if you have proficiency in the Acrobatics or Athletics skill. See “Proficiency” later in this chapter for more information about skill and tool proficiencies.\n\n### Difficulty Class\n\nThe Difficulty Class of an ability check represents the task’s difficulty. The more difficult the task, the higher its DC. The rules provide DCs for certain checks, but the DM ultimately sets them. The Typical Difficulty Classes table presents a range of possible DCs for ability checks.\n\n#### Typical Difficulty Classes\n| Task Difficulty   | DC |\n| ----------------- | -- |\n| Very easy         | 5  |\n| Easy              | 10 |\n| Medium            | 15 |\n| Hard              | 20 |\n| Very hard         | 25 |\n| Nearly impossible | 30 |"

You don’t normally choose to make a save; you must make one because your character or a monster (if you’re the DM) is at risk. A save’s result is detailed in the effect that caused it.\n\nIf you don’t want to resist the effect, you can choose to fail the save without rolling.\n\n### Ability Modifier\n\nSaving throws are named for the ability modifiers they use: a Constitution saving throw, a Wisdom saving throw, and so on. Different saving throws are used to resist different kinds of effects, as shown on the Saving Throw Examples table.\n\n#### Saving Throw Examples\n| Ability      | Make a Save To...              |\n| ------------ | ------------------------------ |\n| Strength     | Physically resist direct force |\n| Dexterity    | Dodge out of harm’s way        |\n| Constitution | Endure a toxic hazard          |\n| Intelligence | Recognize an illusion as fake  |\n| Wisdom       | Resist a mental assault        |\n| Charisma     | Assert your identity           |\n\n### Proficiency Bonus\n\nYou add your Proficiency Bonus to your saving throw if you have proficiency in that kind of save. See “Proficiency” later in this chapter.\n\n### Difficulty Class\n\nThe Difficulty Class for a saving throw is determined by the effect that causes it or by the DM. For example, if a spell forces you to make a save, the DC is determined by the caster’s spellcasting ability and Proficiency Bonus. Monster abilities that call for saves specify the DC."

See “Proficiency” later in this chapter for more information about weapon proficiencies.\n### Armor Class\n\nA creature’s Armor Class represents how well the creature avoids being wounded in combat. The AC of a character is determined at character creation (see chapter 2), whereas the AC of a monster appears in its stat block.\n\n**Calculating AC**. All creatures start with the same base AC calculation:\n\n> **Base AC** = 10 + the creature’s Dexterity modifier\n\nA creature’s AC can then be modified by armor, magic items, spells, and more.\n\n**Only One Base AC**. Some spells and class features give characters a different way to calculate their AC. A character with multiple features that give different ways to calculate AC must choose which one to use; only one base calculation can be in effect for a creature.\n### Rolling 20 or 1\n\nIf you roll a 20 on the d20 (called a “natural 20”) for an attack roll, the attack hits regardless of any modifiers or the target’s AC. This is called a Critical Hit (see “Combat” later in this chapter).\n\nIf you roll a 1 on the d20 (a “natural 1”) for an attack roll, the attack misses regardless of any modifiers or the target’s AC."

Advantage reflects the positive circumstances surrounding a d20 roll, while Disadvantage reflects negative circumstances.\n\nYou usually acquire Advantage or Disadvantage through the use of special abilities and actions. The DM can also decide that circumstances grant Advantage or impose Disadvantage.\n### Roll Two D20s\n\nWhen a roll has either Advantage or Disadvantage, roll a second d20 when you make the roll. Use the higher of the two rolls if you have Advantage, and use the lower roll if you have Disadvantage. For example, if you have Disadvantage and roll an 18 and a 3, use the 3. If you instead have Advantage and roll those numbers, use the 18.\n### They Don’t Stack\n\nIf multiple situations affect a roll and they all grant Advantage on it, you still roll only two d20s. Similarly, if multiple situations impose Disadvantage on a roll, you roll only two d20s.\n\nIf circumstances cause a roll to have both Advantage and Disadvantage, the roll has neither of them, and you roll one d20. This is true even if multiple circumstances impose Disadvantage and only one grants Advantage or vice versa. In such a situation, you have neither Advantage nor Disadvantage.\n### Interactions with Rerolls\n\nWhen you have Advantage or Disadvantage and something in the game lets you reroll or replace the d20, you can reroll or replace only one die, not both. You choose which one.\n\nFor example, if you have **Heroic Inspiration** (see the sidebar) and roll a 3 and an 18 on an ability check that has Advantage or Disadvantage, you could expend your Heroic Inspiration to reroll one of those dice, not both of them.\n\n\n\n>**Heroic Inspiration**\n>\n>Sometimes the DM or a rule gives you Heroic Inspiration. If you have Heroic Inspiration, you can expend it to reroll any die immediately after rolling it, and you must use the new roll.\n>\n>**Only One at a Time**. You can never have more than one instance of Heroic Inspiration. If something gives you Heroic Inspiration and you already have it, you can give it to a player character in your group who lacks it.\n>\n>**Gaining Heroic Inspiration**. Your DM can give you Heroic Inspiration for a variety of reasons. Typically, DMs award it when you do something particularly heroic, in character, or entertaining. It’s a reward for making the game more fun for everyone playing.\n>\n>Other rules might allow your character to gain Heroic Inspiration independent of the DM’s decision. For example, Human characters start each day with Heroic Inspiration."

A character’s Proficiency Bonus increases as the character gains levels (described in chapter 2). A monster’s Proficiency Bonus is based on its Challenge Rating (see the rules glossary). The Proficiency Bonus table shows how the bonus is determined.\n\nThis bonus is applied to a D20 Test when the creature has proficiency in a skill, in a saving throw, or with an item that the creature uses to make the D20 Test. The bonus is also used for spell attacks and for calculating the DC of saving throws for spells.",

Bright Light lets most creatures see normally. Even gloomy days provide Bright Light, as do torches, lanterns, fires, and other sources of illumination within a specific radius.\n\nDim Light. Dim Light, also called shadows, creates a Lightly Obscured area. An area of Dim Light is usually a boundary between Bright Light and surrounding Darkness. The soft light of twilight and dawn also counts as Dim Light. A full moon might bathe the land in Dim Light.\n\nDarkness. Darkness creates a Heavily Obscured area. Characters face Darkness outdoors at night (even most moonlit nights), within the confines of an unlit dungeon, or in an area of magical Darkness.\nSpecial Senses\n\nSome creatures have special senses that help them perceive things in certain situations.

Within that range, you can see anything that isn’t behind Total Cover even if you have the Blinded condition or are in Darkness.

You discern colors in that Darkness only as shades of gray.\n\n**Tremorsense**: A creature with Tremorsense can pinpoint the location of creatures and moving objects within a specific range, provided that the creature with Tremorsense and anything it is detecting are both in contact with the same surface (such as the ground, a wall, or a ceiling) or the same liquid.\n\nTremorsense can’t detect creatures or objects in the air, and it doesn’t count as a form of sight.\n\n#### Truesight\nIf you have Truesight, your vision is enhanced within a specified range. Within that range, your vision pierces through the following:\n\nDarkness. You can see in normal and magical Darkness.\n\nInvisibility. You see creatures and objects that have the Invisible condition.\n\nVisual Illusions.

It isn’t a building or a vehicle, which are composed of many objects.\n### Time-Limited Object Interactions\n\nWhen time is short, such as in combat, interactions with objects are limited: one free interaction per turn. That interaction must occur during a creature’s movement or action. Any additional interactions require the Utilize action, as explained in “Combat” later in this chapter.\n### Finding Hidden Objects\n\nWhen your character searches for hidden things, such as a secret door or a trap, the DM typically asks you to make a Wisdom (Perception) check, provided you describe the character searching in the hidden object’s vicinity. On a success, you find the object, other important details, or both.\n\nIf you describe your character searching nowhere near a hidden object, a Wisdom (Perception) check won’t reveal the object, no matter the check’s total.\n### Carrying Objects\n\nYou can usually carry your gear and treasure without worrying about the weight of those objects. If you try to haul an unusually heavy object or a massive number of lighter objects, the DM might require you to abide by the rules for carrying capacity in the rules glossary.\n### Breaking Objects\n\nAs an action, you can automatically break or otherwise destroy a fragile, nonmagical object, such as a glass container or a piece of paper.

When the creature lands, it has the Prone condition unless it avoids taking any damage from the fall.\n\nA creature that falls into water or another liquid can use its Reaction to make a DC 15 Strength (Athletics) or Dexterity (Acrobatics) check to hit the surface head or feet first. On a successful check, any damage resulting from the fall is halved.\n#### Malnutrition\nA creature needs an amount of food per day based on its size, as shown in the Food Needs per Day table. A creature that eats but consumes less than half the required food for a day must succeed on a DC 10 Constitution saving throw or gain 1 Exhaustion level at the day’s end. A creature that eats nothing for 5 days automatically gains 1 Exhaustion level at the end of the fifth day as well as an additional level at the end of each subsequent day without food.\n\nExhaustion caused by malnutrition can’t be removed until the creature eats the full amount of food required for a day. See also “Exhaustion.”\n\n**Food Needs per Day**\n\n| Size       | Food      |\n| ---------- | --------- |\n| Tiny       | 1/4 pound |\n| Small      | 1 pound   |\n| Medium     | 1 pound   |\n| Large      | 4 pounds  |\n| Huge       | 16 pounds |\n| Gargantuan | 64 pounds |\n\n#### Suffocation\nA creature can hold its breath for a number of minutes equal to 1 plus its Constitution modifier (minimum of 30 seconds) before suffocation begins. When a creature runs out of breath or is choking, it gains 1 Exhaustion level at the end of each of its turns. When a creature can breathe again, it removes all levels of Exhaustion it gained from suffocating."

        "content": "During an adventure, the characters might travel long distances on trips that could take hours or days. The DM can summarize this travel without calculating exact distances or travel times, or the DM might have you use the travel pace rules below.\n\nIf you need to know how fast you can move when every second matters, see the movement rules in “Combat” later in this chapter.\n\n\n>**Marching Order**\n>\n>The adventurers should establish a marching order while they travel, whether indoors or outdoors. A marching order makes it easier to determine which characters are affected by traps, which ones can spot hidden enemies, and which ones are the closest to those enemies if a fight breaks out. You can change your marching order outside combat and record the order any way you like: write it down, for example, or arrange miniatures to show it.\n\n### Travel Pace\n\nWhile traveling outside combat, a group can move at a Fast, Normal, or Slow pace, as shown on the Travel Pace table. The table states how far the party can move in a period of time; if riding horses or other mounts, the group can move twice that distance for 1 hour, after which the mounts need a Short or Long Rest before they can move at that increased pace again (see chapter 6 for a selection of mounts for sale). The Dungeon Master’s Guide has rules that affect which pace you can choose in certain types of terrain.\n\n#### Travel Pace\n\n**Distance Traveled Per...**\n\n| Pace   | Minute   | Hour    | Day      |\n| ------ | -------- | ------- | -------- |\n| Fast   | 400 feet | 4 miles | 30 miles |\n| Normal | 300 feet | 3 miles | 24 miles |\n| Slow   | 200 feet | 2 miles | 18 miles |\n\nEach travel pace has a game effect, as defined below.\n\n**Fast**. Traveling at a Fast pace imposes Disadvantage on a traveler’s Wisdom (Perception or Survival) and Dexterity (Stealth) checks.\n\n**Normal**. Traveling at a Normal pace imposes Disadvantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks.\n\n**Slow**. Traveling at a Slow pace grants Advantage on Wisdom (Perception or Survival) checks.\n\n### Vehicles\n\nTravelers in wagons, carriages, or other land vehicles choose a pace as normal. Characters in a waterborne vessel are limited to the speed of the vessel, and they don’t choose a travel pace. Depending on the vessel and the size of the crew, ships might be able to travel for up to 24 hours per day. Chapter 6 includes vehicles for sale."

    "tabs": [
      {
        "name": "The Order of Combat",
        "content": "A typical combat encounter is a clash between two sides: a flurry of weapon swings, feints, parries, footwork, and spellcasting. The game organizes combat into a cycle of rounds and turns. A round represents about 6 seconds in the game world. During a round, each participant in a battle takes a turn. The order of turns is determined at the beginning of combat when everyone rolls Initiative. Once everyone has taken a turn, the fight continues to the next round if neither side is defeated.\n\n### Combat Step by Step\n\nCombat unfolds in these steps:\n\n1. **Establish Positions**. The Dungeon Master determines where all the characters and monsters are located. Given the adventurers’ marching order or their stated positions in the room or other location, the DM figures out where the adversaries are—how far away and in what direction.\n2. **Roll Initiative**. Everyone involved in the combat encounter rolls Initiative, determining the order of combatants’ turns.\n3. **Take Turns**. Each participant in the battle takes a turn in Initiative order. When everyone involved in the combat has had a turn, the round ends. Repeat this step until the fighting stops.\n\n### Initiative\n\nInitiative determines the order of turns during combat. When combat starts, every participant rolls Initiative; they make a Dexterity check that determines their place in the Initiative order. The DM rolls for monsters. For a group of identical creatures, the DM makes a single roll, so each member of the group has the same Initiative.\n\n**Surprise**. If a combatant is surprised by combat starting, that combatant has Disadvantage on their Initiative roll. For example, if an ambusher starts combat while hidden from a foe who is unaware that combat is starting, that foe is surprised.\n\n**Initiative Order**. A combatant’s check total is called their Initiative count, or Initiative for short. The DM ranks the combatants, from highest to lowest Initiative. This is the order in which they act during each round. The Initiative order remains the same from round to round.\n\n**Ties**. If a tie occurs, the DM decides the order among tied monsters, and the players decide the order among tied characters. The DM decides the order if the tie is between a monster and a player character.\n\n### Your Turn\n\nOn your turn, you can move a distance up to your **Speed** and take one action. You decide whether to move first or take your action first.\n\nThe main actions you can take are listed in “Actions” earlier in this chapter. A character’s features and a monster’s stat block also provide action options. “Movement and Position” later in this chapter gives the rules for movement.\n\n**Communicating**. You can communicate however you are able—through brief utterances and gestures—as you take your turn. Doing so uses neither your action nor your move.\n\nExtended communication, such as a detailed explanation of something or an attempt to persuade a foe, requires an action. The Influence action is the main way you try to influence a monster.\n\n**Interacting with Things**. You can interact with one object or feature of the environment for free, during either your move or action. For example, you could open a door during your move as you stride toward a foe.\n\nIf you want to interact with a second object, you need to take the Utilize action. Some magic items and other special objects always require an action to use, as stated in their descriptions.\n\nThe DM might require you to use an action for any of these activities when it needs special care or when it presents an unusual obstacle. For instance, the DM might require you to take the **Utilize** action to open a stuck door or turn a crank to lower a drawbridge.\n\n**Doing Nothing on Your Turn**. You can forgo moving, taking an action, or doing anything at all on your turn. If you can’t decide what to do, consider taking the defensive **Dodge** action or the **Ready** action to delay acting.\n\n### Ending Combat\n\nCombat ends when one side or the other is defeated, which can mean the creatures are killed or knocked out or have surrendered or fled. Combat can also end when both sides agree to end it."

        "name": "Movement and Position",
        "content": "On your turn, you can move a distance equal to your **Speed** or less. Or you can decide not to move.\n\nYour movement can include **climbing**, **crawling**, **jumping**, and **swimming** (each explained in the rules glossary). These different modes of movement can be combined with your regular movement, or they can constitute your entire move.\n\nHowever you’re moving with your Speed, you deduct the distance of each part of your move from it until it is used up or until you are done moving, whichever comes first.\n\nA character’s Speed is determined during character creation. A monster’s Speed is noted in the monster’s stat block. See the rules glossary for more about Speed as well as about special speeds, such as a **Climb Speed**, **Fly Speed**, or **Swim Speed**.\n\n### Difficult Terrain\n\nCombatants are often slowed down by Difficult Terrain. Low furniture, rubble, undergrowth, steep stairs, snow, and shallow bogs are examples of Difficult Terrain.\n\nEvery foot of movement in Difficult Terrain costs 1 extra foot, even if multiple things in a space count as Difficult Terrain.\n\n\n\n>**Playing on a Grid**\n>\n>If you play using a square grid and miniatures or other tokens, follow these rules.\n>\n>**Squares**. Each square represents 5 feet.\n>\n>**Speed**. Rather than moving foot by foot, move square by square on the grid, using your Speed in 5-foot segments. You can translate your Speed into squares by dividing it by 5. For example, a Speed of 30 feet translates into 6 squares. If you use a grid often, consider writing your Speed in squares on your character sheet.\n>\n>**Entering a Square**. To enter a square, you must have enough movement left to pay for entering. It costs 1 square of movement to enter an unoccupied square that’s adjacent to your space (orthogonally or diagonally adjacent). A square of Difficult Terrain costs 2 squares to enter. Other effects might make a square cost even more.\n>\n>**Corners**. Diagonal movement can’t cross the corner of a wall, a large tree, or another terrain feature that fills its space.\n>\n>**Ranges**. To determine the range on a grid between two things—whether creatures or objects—count squares from a square adjacent to one of them and stop counting in the space of the other one. Count by the shortest route.\n\n### Breaking Up Your Move\n\nYou can break up your move, using some of its movement before and after any action, Bonus Action, or Reaction you take on the same turn. For example, if you have a Speed of 30 feet, you could go 10 feet, take an action, and then go 20 feet.\n\n### Dropping Prone\n\nOn your turn, you can give yourself the Prone condition (see the rules glossary) without using an action or any of your Speed, but you can’t do so if your Speed is 0.\n\n### Creature Size\n\nA creature belongs to a size category, which determines the width of the square space the creature occupies on a map, as shown on the Creature Size and Space table. That table lists the sizes from smallest (Tiny) to largest (Gargantuan). A creature’s space is the area that it effectively controls in combat and the area it needs to fight effectively.\n\nA character’s size is determined by species, and a monster’s size is specified in the monster’s stat block.\n\n**Creature Size and Space**\n\n| Size       | Space (Feet)  | Space (Squares)     |\n| ---------- | ------------- | ------------------- |\n| Tiny       | 2½ by 2½ feet | 4 per square        |\n| Small      | 5 by 5 feet   | 1 square            |\n| Medium     | 5 by 5 feet   | 1 square            |\n| Large      | 10 by 10 feet | 4 squares (2 by 2)  |\n| Huge       | 15 by 15 feet | 9 squares (3 by 3)  |\n| Gargantuan | 20 by 20 feet | 16 squares (4 by 4) |\n\n### Moving around Other Creatures\n\nDuring your move, you can pass through the space of an ally, a creature that has the **Incapacitated** condition (see the rules glossary), a Tiny creature, or a creature that is two sizes larger or smaller than you.\n\nAnother creature’s space is **Difficult Terrain** for you unless that creature is Tiny or your ally.\n\nYou can’t willingly end a move in a space occupied by another creature. If you somehow end a turn in a space with another creature, you have the **Prone** condition (see the rules glossary) unless you are Tiny or are of a larger size than the other creature."

Pick a target within your attack’s range: a creature, an object, or a location.\n2. **Determine Modifiers**. The DM determines whether the target has **Cover** (see the next section) and whether you have **Advantage** or **Disadvantage** against the target. In addition, spells, special abilities, and other effects can apply penalties or bonuses to your attack roll.\n3. **Resolve the Attack**. Make the attack roll, as detailed earlier in this chapter.

If a ranged attack, such as one made with a spell, has a single range, you can’t attack a target beyond this range.\n\nSome ranged attacks, such as those made with a **Longbow**, have two ranges. The smaller number is the normal range, and the larger number is the long range. Your attack roll has **Disadvantage** when your target is beyond normal range, and you can’t attack a target beyond long range.\n\n### Ranged Attacks in Close Combat\n\nAiming a ranged attack is more difficult when a foe is next to you. When you make a ranged attack roll with a weapon, a spell, or some other means, you have **Disadvantage** on the roll if you are within 5 feet of an enemy who can see you and doesn’t have the **Incapacitated** condition (see the rules glossary)."

Certain creatures have melee attacks with a reach greater than 5 feet, as noted in their descriptions.\n\n### Opportunity Attacks\n\nCombatants watch for enemies to drop their guard. If you move heedlessly past your foes, you put yourself in danger by provoking an Opportunity Attack.\n\n**Avoiding Opportunity Attack**. You can avoid provoking an Opportunity Attack by taking the **Disengage** action. You also don’t provoke an Opportunity Attack when you **Teleport** or when you are moved without using your movement, action, Bonus Action, or Reaction. For example, you don’t provoke an Opportunity Attack if an explosion hurls you out of a foe’s reach or if you fall past an enemy.\n\n**Making an Opportunity Attack**. You can make an Opportunity Attack when a creature that you can see leaves your reach. To make the attack, take a Reaction to make one melee attack with a weapon or an **Unarmed Strike** against that creature. The attack occurs right before it leaves your reach."

Doing so costs an amount of movement equal to half your Speed (round down). For example, if your Speed is 30 feet, you spend 15 feet of movement to mount a horse.\n\n### Controlling a Mount\n\nYou can control a mount only if it has been trained to accept a rider. Domesticated horses, mules, and similar creatures have such training.\n\nThe Initiative of a controlled mount changes to match yours when you mount it. It moves on your turn as you direct it, and it has only three action options during that turn: **Dash**, **Disengage**, and **Dodge**. A controlled mount can move and act even on the turn that you mount it.\n\nIn contrast, an independent mount—one that lets you ride but ignores your control—retains its place in the Initiative order and moves and acts as it likes.\n\n### Falling Off\n\nIf an effect is about to move your mount against its will while you’re on it, you must succeed on a DC 10 Dexterity saving throw or fall off, landing with the Prone condition (see the rules glossary) in an unoccupied space within 5 feet of the mount.\n\nWhile mounted, you must make the same save if you’re knocked **Prone** or the mount is."

A monster dies the instant it drops to 0 Hit Points, although a Dungeon Master can ignore this rule for an individual monster and treat it like a character.\n\n**Hit Point Maximum of 0**. A creature dies if its Hit Point maximum reaches 0. Certain effects drain life energy, reducing a creature’s Hit Point maximum.\n\n**Massive Damage**. When damage reduces a character to 0 Hit Points and damage remains, the character dies if the remainder equals or exceeds their Hit Point maximum. For example, if your character has a Hit Point maximum of 12, currently has 6 Hit Points, and takes 18 damage, the character drops to 0 Hit Points, but 12 damage remains. The character then dies, since 12 equals their Hit Point maximum.\n\n### Character Demise\n\nIf your character dies, others might find a magical way to revive your character, such as with the Raise Dead spell. Or talk with the DM about making a new character to join the group. The rules glossary has more information on being dead.\n\n### Falling Unconscious\n\nIf you reach 0 Hit Points and don’t die instantly, you have the **Unconscious** condition (see the rules glossary) until you regain any Hit Points, and you now face making **Death Saving Throws** (see below).\n\n\n>**Knocking Out a Creature**\n>\n>When you would reduce a creature to 0 Hit Points with a melee attack, you can instead reduce the creature to 1 Hit Point and give it the **Unconscious** condition. It then starts a **Short Rest**, at the end of which that condition ends on it. The condition ends early if the creature regains any Hit Points or if someone takes an action to administer first aid to it, making a successful DC 10 Wisdom (**Medicine**) check.\n\n### Death Saving Throws\n\nWhenever you start your turn with 0 Hit Points, you must make a Death Saving Throw to determine whether you creep closer to death or hang on to life. Unlike other saving throws, this one isn’t tied to an ability score. You’re in the hands of fate now.\n\n**Three Successes/Failures**. Roll 1d20. If the roll is 10 or higher, you succeed. Otherwise, you fail. A success or failure has no effect by itself. On your third success, you become Stable (see “Stabilizing a Character” below). On your third failure, you die.\n\nThe successes and failures don’t need to be consecutive; keep track of both until you collect three of a kind. The number of both is reset to zero when you regain any Hit Points or become Stable.\n\n**Rolling a 1 or 20**. When you roll a 1 on the d20 for a Death Saving Throw, you suffer two failures. If you roll a 20 on the d20, you regain 1 Hit Point.\n\n**Damage at 0 Hit Points**. If you take any damage while you have 0 Hit Points, you suffer a Death Saving Throw failure. If the damage is from a Critical Hit, you suffer two failures instead. If the damage equals or exceeds your Hit Point maximum, you die.\n\n### Stabilizing a Character\n\nYou can take the **Help** action to try to stabilize a creature with 0 Hit Points, which requires a successful DC 10 Wisdom (Medicine) check.\n\nA Stable creature doesn’t make Death Saving Throws even though it has 0 Hit Points, but it still has the **Unconscious** condition. If the creature takes damage, it stops being Stable and starts making Death Saving Throws again. A Stable creature that isn’t healed regains 1 Hit Point after 1d4 hours."

        "name": "Temporary Hit Points",
        "content": "Some spells and other effects confer Temporary Hit Points, which are a buffer against losing actual Hit Points, as explained below.\n\n### Lose Temporary Hit Points First\n\nIf you have Temporary Hit Points and take damage, those points are lost first, and any leftover damage carries over to your Hit Points. For example, if you have 5 Temporary Hit Points and take 7 damage, you lose those points and then lose 2 Hit Points.\n\n### Duration\n\nTemporary Hit Points last until they’re depleted or you finish a **Long Rest** (see the rules glossary).\n\n### Temporary Hit Points Don’t Stack\n\nTemporary Hit Points can’t be added together. If you have Temporary Hit Points and receive more of them, you decide whether to keep the ones you have or to gain the new ones. For example, if a spell grants you 12 Temporary Hit Points when you already have 10, you can have 12 or 10, not 22.\n\n### They’re Not Hit Points or Healing\n\nTemporary Hit Points can’t be added to your Hit Points, healing can’t restore them, and receiving Temporary Hit Points doesn’t count as healing. Because Temporary Hit Points aren’t Hit Points, a creature can be at full Hit Points and receive Temporary Hit Points.\n\nIf you have 0 Hit Points, receiving Temporary Hit Points doesn’t restore you to consciousness. Only true healing can save you."
